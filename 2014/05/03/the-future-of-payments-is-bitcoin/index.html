<h4 id="ohbitcoin">Oh, Bitcoin.</h4>

<p>"Beware the mania for Bitcoin, the tulip of the 21st century," states <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8cd97efe-7c6f-11e3-b514-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2xDKvtQ00">Jean-Pierre Landau</a>.</p>

<p>“Bitcoin is evil," decries <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/Bitcoin-is-evil/">Paul Krugman</a>.</p>

<p>Financial experts are quick to point out that the recent popularity and excitement surrounding Bitcoin does not necessarily translate into its economic reality.</p>

<p>Yet, Bitcoin disrupts the conventional way people think about and use money. It is not paper-based, but rather Internet-based. Bitcoin, at its core, is a breakthrough in computer science. It provides an unequivocal and secure method for one Internet user to transfer a piece of unique digital property to another Internet user. </p>

<p>The real disruptive power of Bitcoin to our economy and society does not lie in its intrinsic value as a currency, but rather in its underlying platform, the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is the currency of the future because its technological basis enables it to transform one of the fundamental things that people do - make payments.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinsdecentralizedpeertopeersystemdisruptshowfinancialinstitutionsprocesspayment">Bitcoin’s decentralized, peer-to-peer system disrupts how financial institutions process payment.</h4>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument that provides a secure, decentralized way to record and transfer ownership rights of money and assets between unrelated parties, without the presence of a trusted intermediary. The Bitcoin protocol is a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/02/15/bitcoin-platform-currency/1/">Big Bang Disruption</a> that runs the world’s first truly open financial network. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spendinghttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> used to plague creators of digital cash: how do you prevent a person from using the same digital coin twice. Before Bitcoin, the only solution was to have a central authority to approve a transaction as final. However, <a href="http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, through Bitcoin, was the first to create an electronic system to solve the double-spending problem in a completely, decentralized fashion.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin block chain serves as a decentralized, shared public ledger that, as a whole, keeps track of Bitcoin addresses. Through a safe, transparent, and mathematically secure method, ownership rights to digital money flow directly from the sender’s digital wallet to the receiver’s digital wallet. Bitcoin offers a peer-to-peer system that removes people’s need for a central authority to process monetary transactions when making payments.</p>

<p>Whereas financial institutions heavily safeguard their private ledgers, anyone can validate transactions and ownership of all Bitcoins anytime they want. This ensures not only the security, but also the transparency of financial assets stored in the Bitcoin network. Anyone can buy into the distributed ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots (aka the digital “coins”); owners of these slots can sell out of the ledger anytime, anywhere by trading their Bitcoin to someone else that wants to buy into the ledger. Bitcoin’s public ledger makes transaction fees much, much lower than those of a central bank, and eliminates authorization imposed by a central authority; Bitcoin users can directly buy in or out of the ledger at little to no cost when making payments.</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network disrupts the traditional operation of financial institutions. First, there is the impossibility of financial censorship by a single party because the Bitcoin ledger is public. Therefore, all payment transactions are logged and openly displayed.  Second, since transactions must be confirmed at least six times by computers across a distributed network, there is no single point of failure. Therefore, payment fraud can be easily detected. Third, unlike a private ledger kept by banks, Bitcoin transactions are completely transparent, allowing for financial openness and promoting trust for Bitcoin as an accepted payment system.</p>

<p>Marc Andreessen asserts that Bitcoin’s future lies in <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">a classic network effect</a>, a positive feedback loop driven by the self-interested participation of four distinct groups: (1) consumers (2) merchants (3) miners and (4) developers and entrepreneurs. Bitcoin miners run the computers that process and validate the transactions that take place across the cryptocurrency’s decentralized network. Anyone with the technical know-how can download the Bitcoin open-source mining software and build their own mining rig. In addition, as their reward, miners can earn 25 bitcoins for solving ever-increasing computational problems that process Bitcoin transactions. The ease of participation on the Bitcoin platform, along with the incentive to process Bitcoin transactions, supports the decentralized network that enables Bitcoin to not only pose a threat to financial institutions, but to also gain popularity as a form of accepted currency and payment system.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinasatechnologicalplatformdrivesfinancialinnovationforpaymentsystems">Bitcoin as a technological platform drives financial innovation for payment systems.</h4>

<p>The more people that use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin becomes for everyone to use it, providing a higher incentive for the next person to start using the technology. Bitcoin as an evolving technological platform not only makes the digital currency easier for newcomers to use, but transforms money into "<a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/02/15/bitcoin-platform-currency/1/">smart money</a>". It enables developers and entrepreneurs, a group that is part of Andreessen’s four-sided network effect, to create consumer products and services on top of the Bitcoin platform that have been, until recently, impossible. With more products and services that utilize Bitcoin, the more prevalent Bitcoin becomes as an adopted payment system.</p>

<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/bitcoin-is-a-money-platform-with-many-apis.html">Bitcoin makes money programmable</a>, hence why it is so popular among developers. it is an application programming interface (API) for money that provides the opportunity for developers to create countless financial innovations. Bitcoin not only offers an API for personal accounts and transactions, but makes that API available to coders. As a predominantly, developer-driven technology, Bitcoin gives its users the power to define the usage and control of money, leading to a faster rate of product innovation of Bitcoin as a payment system with broader consumer appeal.</p>

<p>Traditional money do have APIs, but <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/bitcoin-is-a-money-platform-with-many-apis.html">they are closed to regular people</a>. In a traditional financial network, trust between parties is achieved through a complex web of regulations, fraud detection, and accreditation. Financial networks are protected through exclusivity: APIs are closed and inaccessible except to the few that are trusted. For example, Mastercard and Paypal limit who can build applications on top of their platforms and what those applications can do. However, trust in the Bitcoin financial model is distributed across a large and ever-growing network of collaborators who continuously validate each other’s activity. As a result, there is no need for access controls or exclusivity to maintain Bitcoin as a secure way for payment. Everyone can participate in the Bitcoin network and access the APIs.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested in just under 50 million dollars in Bitcoin-related startups and actively searches for more Bitcoin-related investment opportunities. The firm believes that the network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance as a widespread payment system in the not-so-distant future. One of the most exciting applications include building <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/17/bitcoin-for-idiots-an-introductory-guide/">a Bitcoin platform for international remittance</a>. Because Bitcoin transaction fees are much lower than the amount that banks and payments companies extract from international transactions, switching to Bitcoin will enable immigrants to keep more of the money that they send to their families in their home countries. In addition, Bitcoin presents <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">further opportunities in micropayments</a>, and can be a catalyst that drives the development of modern economic systems in third world countries. These are the types of possibilities that make Bitcoin evangelists so excited about the cryptocurrency and its potential for innovation and widespread adoption as a payment system.</p>

<h4 id="bitcointhetechnologypromotesadoptionofbitcointhecurrencyasamethodofpayment">Bitcoin the technology promotes adoption of Bitcoin the currency as a method of payment.</h4>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency whose value is based on (1) the use of the payment system today and (2) future speculation of the use of the payment system. It is not that the Bitcoin currency has an arbitrary value and people are trading it. Rather, it is because Bitcoin is used for trading that as a result, the cryptocurrency has value. Although the current value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than its actual payment volume, Bitcoin’s value has increased dramatically during recent months because <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">speculation have made more people aware of the reality of its usefulness for payments</a>.</p>

<p>Edward Hadas, Reuters’ economics editor, calls Bitcoin “<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/Bitcoin-a-fools-gold-standard/">a Fool’s Gold Standard</a>.” Critics of Bitcoin point out that even though Bitcoin operates like mainstream currencies, it will never attain the real value associated with conventional money because it is not backed by a central bank. They argue that Bitcoin’s volatility not only makes the predictability of its value impossible, but can render them almost worthless. Yet every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using, and selling Bitcoins all around the world. As Bitcoin tools and technology are improved by developers and entrepreneurs, the cryptocurrency becomes easier, and more secure for everyone to use. And as more and more people use Bitcoin, the value of the digital currency will also expand and drive its adoption as a popular payment system among mainstream users.</p>

<p>Critics of Bitcoin also highlight that given the small number of consumers who currently pay with the digital currency, <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/01/24/why-bitcoin-could-fail/">its volatility makes it unappealing to merchants</a>. Yet why would merchants not be interested in a digital alternative for businesses <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">when conventional payment fees consume nearly half of profit margins</a> and conventional payment methods make accepting international payments difficult? </p>

<p>In addition, merchants are attracted to Bitcoin because <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/30/credit-card-security-is-broken-heres-how-bitcoin-could-help-fix-it/">its technological protocol eliminates the risk of credit card fraud</a>. The receiver of a payment through Bitcoin does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future. The digital currency’s technological basis in cryptography protects the private information of receivers and senders, while its distributed ledger ensures the validity of all payment transactions taking place in the network. Bitcoin is different from conventional methods of electronic payment because <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/30/credit-card-security-is-broken-heres-how-bitcoin-could-help-fix-it/">it puts the liability of the payment on the payer</a>. Because merchants know that payments via Bitcoin are coming directly from the buyer and that payments via Bitcoin from the buyer are irreversible, merchants can increase their profit margins by accepting Bitcoin for payment.</p>

<p>One thing that both critics and developers agree on is that Bitcoin’s number one issue is security. On February 7, 2014, Mt.Gox, the Japan-based exchange that once held 80% of the world’s Bitcoin trades, halted withdrawals of the digital currency due to transaction malleability, an attack that changes the unique ID of a Bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the Bitcoin network. Critics were quick to highlight the shutdown of Mt.Gox and the subsequent drop in Bitcoin prices as a sign of the ‘<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bug-guide-transaction-malleability/">cryptocalypse</a>’, the end of the Bitcoin world as we know it. Yet despite the media hype of Mt. Gox, it is easy to forget that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/bitcoin-is-the-new-paypal/?ncid=fb">Bitcoin is a nascent technology</a> and that fraud can occur on multiple fronts to other Bitcoin services as well. Developers are aware that Bitcoin presents some of the most interesting and challenging computer science problems to solve right now, and that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/05/bitcoins-future-foretold-by-developer-momentum/">multifaceted solutions are required to prevent future fraud</a>.</p>

<p>From a technological standpoint, Bitcoin’s transaction malleability problems are no more than fixable software bugs, common to all emerging software technologies. Although a major Bitcoin exchange has been shut down, transaction malleability does not break the core of Bitcoin operation. Its decentralized network forms the crux of the digital currency’s appeal to not only developers, miners, and entrepreneurs, but also to consumers who pay with Bitcoin and merchants who accept Bitcoin.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinisforthepeople">Bitcoin is for the people.</h4>

<p>In truth, only time can tell Bitcoin’s viability as a long-term currency. However, its future as the go-to payment system of tomorrow is brighter than ever before. Because it operates as a distributed, peer-to-peer system that promotes financial transparency, Bitcoin eliminates the need for financial institutions as a third party to confirm payment transactions. Its basis as an evolving technology platform provide countless opportunities for developer and entrepreneurs to redefine conventional methods of payment. Lastly, Bitcoin the technology drives adoption of Bitcoin the currency as an accepted form of payment among merchants and consumers because it is circulated directly between buyers and sellers, and requires no authorization and little to no transaction fees.</p>

<p>In an allusion to the famous quote from Abe Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Bitcoin, especially  the technology as a form of payment, is “of the people”, “by the people”, and “for the people.” Who knows if it will ultimately “perish from the earth”? But from where it stands today, Bitcoin has no chance of doing so anytime in the near future. And if you need proof that Bitcoin is what Gavin Andresen, chief-scientist of Bitcoin Foundation, calls the “<a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html">decentralized currency of the people</a>”, have you heard of <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fan-holding-sign-espn-racks-25000-bitcoin-donations/">the Auburn fan who racked up over $24,000 in Bitcoin through ESPN</a>?</p>
