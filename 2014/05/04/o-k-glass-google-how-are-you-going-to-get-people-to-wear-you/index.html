            <p>Ubiquitous computing makes its possible for the user to access the computer and Internet everywhere and anywhere. The Glass technology is Google’s dream in turning this hands-free computing idea into reality. Although Google has already solved some of the hardest technical challenges associated with Glass, its biggest problem is not technological, but rather behavioral: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/technology/google-looks-to-make-its-computer-glasses-stylish.html?_r=0">how to get the average Joe to actually wear the futuristic headset</a>.</p>

<p>Glass is a completely new type of computing device because it changes the fundamental way that humans use computers, shifting the interaction paradigm from touch to voice. Glass is wearable, designed to reduce distraction commonly associated with laptops and smartphones, and created to seamlessly integrate in the daily routines of its user. As described in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates">an intimate product review from the Verge</a>, Glass is the “anti-smartphone, explicitly fashioned to blow apart our notions of how we interact with technology.” </p>

<p>Google’s Glass Explorer Program was originally purposed to <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/faq/">explore a broad spectrum of user interaction</a> that the wearable tech could potentially provide. Since its launch in April 2013, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:2368/2014/05/04/o-k-glass-google-how-are-you-going-to-get-people-to-wear-you/Program&#32;http://www.google.com/glass/start/explorer-stories/">the program has showcased a wide variety of innovative user applications</a>, ranging from wildlife conservation of endangered species to providing firefighters a hands-free means to work more efficiently and safely.  Although Glass has proven itself to be quite a useful and promising technology in providing significant benefits to human lives in niche situations, some claim that the Explorer Program “wasn’t much of a product rollout as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarunwadhwa/2014/04/24/the-google-glass-explorer-program-was-a-social-experiment-that-backfired/">it was a social experiment</a>.”  In other words, Google, as part of its marketing strategy, released a prototype into the human jungle to simply see how society would react to Glass.</p>

<p>Yet no matter how disruptive Glass may seem in changing the way humans currently interact with computing devices, Google still needs to push heavily for mainstream adoption of Glass. The designers of Glass are quick to point out that since the advent of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, human beings have begun to spend the majority of their time looking through a lens or down at a screen. That is a big problem, but it is not entirely a new type of problem. Humans have been distracted by new technologies before and found ways to manage that distraction (think radios and driving a car). Thus, in order for Google to successfully tackle the Goliath of Glass’ challenges, the search company must embrace both design and empathy in developing a piece of wearable technology that seamlessly integrates with human senses. </p>

<p>The search company needs to prove to each and every human being that Glass will not only significantly improve the way we run our daily lives, but will also connect us to our friends and family in the most natural – and most social – way possible. Now that is an ambitious task, considering how difficult it is to change human behavior on a widespread scale.</p>

<p>Supporters of Glass assert that that its transformative potential rests in its basis as a wearable device, but when discussing the social implications of the technology, argue that its functionality is no different than that of a smartphone. Luckily for me, I had the opportunity to explore this debate firsthand. I managed to secure a Google Glass from my tech-savvy computer science professor. Through a five-day trial of the futuristic headset, I wanted to experience for myself the alluring possibilities that Glass holds and what it currently brings, and what it could potentially bring, to a user that a smartphone simply could not.</p>

<h4 id="okglasstakeapicture">“OK, Glass. Take a picture.”</h4>

<p>(That was the very first command I gave to my Glass unit. Therefore, it deserves special status as a title of a section in this post.)</p>

<h4 id="okglassshowmewhatsgood">“OK, Glass. Show me what’s good.”</h4>

<p>Simply taking Google Glass out of its box was a pristine moment. After linking Glass to my Google account, I was taken to the timeline, the main user interface comprised of 640 x 360 pixels cards representing events in the past, present, and future. My main interaction with this UI was through the touchpad on the side of Glass. When I scrolled to the right of the Glass clock card, I was presented with the history section that comprised of static cards displaying text, images, and video content. After scrolling to the left of the Glass clock card, I ventured into the present and future section of the timeline, displaying cards that presented me with relevant information pertaining to the current moment, like the time and weather.</p>

<p>Starting Glass with the timeline experience is a clever strategy to transition long-term smartphone users to the wearable technology, without having users abandon their accustomed methods of tactile interaction with computing devices. For me, at least, having the same notifications that I would receive on the smartphone delivered straight to my face via Glass felt imposing. Also, the process of adapting to UI transitions that moved perpendicularly to the direction of touch gestures on the touchpad of Glass, instead of in parallel on a smartphone, felt peculiar as well. </p>

<h4 id="okglasssendamessage">“OK, Glass. Send a message.”</h4>

<p>In terms of email, I could quickly check and send messages on Glass through voice-enabled commands. However, accessing menu items to reply or forward emails using a touchpad located on the side of my hand felt cumbersome and unintuitive. Functionality associated with replying to an email and forwarding an email to another person could have been integrated with voice commands and make using email on Glass an even more efficient process than it is now. In future iterations, I think Glass will greatly benefit from a completely voice-activated email system, making a once-dreaded task simple and easy to do on-the-go for working professionals.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a user, the ability to operate a camera hands-free is probably one of Glass’ most convenient functions. Not only does the picture quality on Glass rivals that of a smartphone, but being able to document one’s life from a first-person perspective and easily share the picture or recording with loved ones on Glass really captures Google’s mission in designing the wearable technology to complement the user’s life experience and to help the user closely connect with friends and family. Now to think of it, what is a better way to share a good experience than from the eye of the person who experienced it?</p>

<p>Lastly, I found the experience of asking Glass to Google a query and having the exact result displayed in front of my views to be quite powerful and exhilarating, even if at times the natural language search was a tad off in capturing the exact query. This feature is very useful because the information that I received did not obstruct my vision as I carried out my daily routine. The wearable’s voice-enabled search clearly illustrates the benefit of augmented reality when information is needed at a moment’s notice.</p>

<h4 id="okglasstakeanote">“OK, Glass. Take a note.”</h4>

<p>At first, it felt frustrating and cumbersome to navigate through the timeline with the touchpad and interact with Glassware through voice commands. Having been accustomed to interacting with computing devices through touch, I realized that Glass presents a new frontier of human-computer interaction that Google dares to explore.</p>

<p>In its prototype stage, Glass feels more or less like an advanced version of a smartphone. The device’s mixture of voice and touch human-computer interaction demonstrates its hands-free potential, but more work is needed in refining the natural language processing and minimalizing tactile methods of interaction in order for Glass to bring true hands-free value to the user.</p>

<p>Unless the user knows exactly what he or she wants to explore with Glass (and understands the social implications of being a ‘Glasshole’), the $1500 will not bring much added value to most smartphone-accustomed people. Yet, the current prototype barely scratches the tip of the iceberg that represents the wearable’s potential, leaving much room for UI/UX innovation to encompass a wide variety of user needs and applications.</p>

<p>In terms of pushing for the mainstream adoption of Glass, Google’s biggest challenge is in convincing people to wear the device. Glass the technology possesses great potential in changing the lives of its users for the better. However, Google needs to clearly market this potential through a much more appealing design of Glass that expertly conveys the company’s sense and understanding of user empathy.</p>
