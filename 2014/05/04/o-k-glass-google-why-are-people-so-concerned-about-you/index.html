            <p>Since the launch of the Google Glass Explorer Program, ‘Glassholes’, the derogatory name dubbed for early adopters of the wearable technology, have obtained minor celebrity status. Curious people approach them with questions about the still-rare technology, even asking to try Glass out and getting their pictures taken. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/10/tech/mobile/negative-google-glass-reactions/">Others are quite confrontational</a>, angry that ‘Glassholes’ even dare to wear recording devices on their faces in public and potentially invade the privacy of those around them.  Negative reactions to Google Glass make headlines often, and the technology has been banned, even prior to its initial 2013 release, in many bars and restaurants for the device’s potential privacy-violating capabilities. </p>

<p><img src="../../../../content/images/2014/May/no-glassholes-allowed.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowareyousodifferentfromasmartphone">“OK, Glass. Google how are you so different from a smartphone?”</h4>

<p>Smartphones and Glass share many technological features, such as having cameras to record videos and audio and take photographs and being able to instantly upload information to social media sites. Yet, the wearable device has elicited very different reactions than the ones its smartphone counterparts faced in the past. Because there are very few Google Glass units used by consumers, people do not really grasp the limitations of the device. Anti-glass sentiments arise because unlike smartphones, the wearable is a piece of technology that stands outside of an individual’s sphere of control or influence. With smartphones, users have a choice to stay connected with technology, but with Glass, the ability to make that choice can be taken away from them by someone else’s decision.</p>

<p>Critics have especially raised concerns regarding Glass’ capabilities for the intrusion of privacy. With smartphones, the user would need to physically hold up the phone’s camera and point it at the subject, thus providing a visual cue of whether the user is recording the subject. However, with Glass, because there is no external indicator light that shows when Glass is in recording mode, people see Glass as a heavy intrusion of their privacy, fearful of being recorded in public without their knowledge or consent by Glass wearers.</p>

<p>The privacy fear is not only rooted in in the act of a Glass wearer recording another without informed consent, but also that the recording can be uploaded to Google’s servers, potentially stored for the rest of a person’s lifetime and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/06/google-glass-threat-to-our-privacy">be made available to access by anyone</a>. With Google Glass, the fear associated with being recorded in public without permission is greatly magnified because the nascent device evokes an uncomfortable feeling of a <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/controversy-grows-over-googles-glass-project/article4553860.ece">constant, invasive surveillance</a> through a ubiquitous computing network controlled by Google. </p>

<h4 id="okglassgoogleareyougoingtoturnpeopleintocyborgs">“OK, Glass. Google are you going to turn people into cyborgs?”</h4>

<p>In addition, critics question the etiquette and ethics of using Glass in public. A London-based campaign group, ‘<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-glass-will-make-privacy-impossible-warn-stop-the-cyborgs-campaigners-8550499.html">Stop the Cyborgs</a>’ are calling for limits in which the technology is used and that guidelines should be in place to inform the public when they are being filmed. The privacy advocacy group does not seek to ban the wearable device altogether, but “encourage individual people to think about the impact of new technologies, to set bounds on how new technologies are used (and) proactively negotiate their relationship with the future.” As Google’s Eric Schmidt puts it, with the emergence of Google Glass for consumer use, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10015697/Google-Glass-well-all-need-etiquette-lessons.html">new social etiquette</a> will need to be developed to justify the appropriate use of this novel wearable and to ensure people’s privacy. </p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowhardistoforyoutogethacked">“OK, Glass. Google how hard is to for you to get hacked?”</h4>

<p>Glass’ lack of a PIN or authentication system is possibly one of the most direct threats to the owner’s privacy. However, <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/glass-privacy-concern-dismissal-doesnt-pacify-us-congress-committee-02288698/">in response to a US congressional committee concerned with this issue</a>, Google has confirmed that it is currently working on <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/glass-boutique-app-store-mp3-player-lock-screen-more-revealed-05289182/">a lock system</a> for Glass to protect private information stored on the device.</p>

<p>In its prototype stage, Glass can also be easily hacked. A Santa Barbara-based programmer discovered that Glass has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/01/google-glass-security-privacy-risk">a ‘root’ capability</a> that can be enabled by attaching it to a desktop computer and activating some commands.  That means, if an attacker gains access to another’s Glass, they will be able to monitor the wearer’s every move, take pictures of the wearer’s surrounding, and potentially gain access to the wearer’s private information. Because of the way that Glass is designed, the wearable is susceptible to many of the security issues that plague Android devices. </p>

<p>Another technical feature of Glass that might greatly threaten consumer privacy is the implementation of a facial recognition system. Despite Google’s attempts to <a href="https://developers.google.com/glass/policies">prohibit the installation of such technology onto Glass unit</a>, hackers have already circumvented this policy by building <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/17/202725167/clever-hacks-give-google-glass-many-unintended-powers?v=Szc6FydhxJE">non-Google approved operating systems</a>. To continue pushing for the mainstream adoption of Glass, Google needs to take initiative to set a standard of strong privacy standards and practices for wearable technology that parallels its existing Internet services.  Although Google claims that it has built Glass to put users in control to protect their privacy, the fact that the search company <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/">reserves its right to changes its policies at any time and without notice</a> makes full, informed consent impractical. </p>

<p>Google has taken measures to address the privacy controversy surrounding Glass, asserting that its Glass Explorer program will enable early participants to shape “the future of this technology, including its features and social norms.” The search company’s greatest challenge in promoting the widespread adoption for Glass is to balance opportunities for the technology and those who are keen to explore it with those who are concerned with the technology’s capability to intrude the privacy of the wearer and those the wearer may come into contact with. For what may be the most high-profile product entry into the tech market, Google has drawn up <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers">a list of Do’s and Don’ts</a> for current and potential Glass explorers to ease up public fears about privacy and social tensions that the device may cause to others in preparation for the device’s mass-market release in the upcoming years.</p>
