<h4 id="chinagoestechsaavy">China goes tech-saavy.</h4>

<p>In the 1970s, and especially during the 1990s, foreign direct investments have improved the quality of the Chinese high technology industry. In 2001, China's 145 million mobile phone users were the largest in the world. After surpassing Japan in 2002, by 2010, if not earlier, China is expected to overtake the United States as the world's largest PC market.</p>

<p>In the past thirty or so years, "Made in China" products have moved past toys, clothing, and shows, and now include consumer electronic and high-tech products. In 2003, Chinese high-tech exports valued at 113 billion US dollars.</p>

<p>However, can the Chinese economy and its high-tech industry sustain such high-speed growth? In 2001, China became a member of the World Trade Organization, becoming more deeply integrated into the world economy, yet facing a much fiercer international competition. In the 21st century, how is China developing its indigenous technological industry to support its competitiveness in world markets? Let us examine the country's smartphone, social media, and e-commerce markets to address these two questions.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/xiaomi.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="inchinatherearesmartphoneseverywhereliterallyeverywhere">In China, there are smartphones everywhere. Literally everywhere.</h4>

<p>The number of active smartphones in China exceeded 700 million by the end of 2013, says a new report from analytics firm Umeng. Because China has the world's largest number of active smartphone users, many domestic and international companies want to grab a slice of this lucrative market.</p>

<p>As the price of smartphones drastically decreases, more first-time users are buying their first smartphones. A majority, close to 57% of Android devices sold in China last year were lower than $350. High-end smartphones were priced at $500, accounting for 27% of smartphones sold last year; of that amount, 80% were Apple iPhones. In the Android marketplace, Korean-based Samsung and Chinese-based Xiaomi dominated.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's smartphones are currently sold in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, its hiring of a new Vice President of Xiaomi Global shows that the three-year old company plans to strengthen its competitiveness in international markets. Xiaomi's track record of rapid growth and saavy marketing indicates that this Chinese-based company will quickly become a mighty competitor in the US smartphone market.</p>

<p>The dream of Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun is to build a smartphone company that can compete with Apple. Despite China's reputation for manufacturing low-cost, low-quality goods, Lei Jun wants to push the idea that China has the ability to manufacture high-end hardware.</p>

<p>Xiaomi challenges Samsung in the Chinese smartphone marketplace. In the later half of 2013, Xiaomi's Mi 2S was the most popular smartphone in the Chinese market, followed by Samsung's Galaxy S4.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's successful sales can be contributed to the company's willingness to try alternative marketing strategies. By utilizing social media to gather user feedback, Xiaomi has also gained a loyal fanbase. Yet, Xiaomi still needs to prove the competitive advantage of its smartphones on the international market.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/alibaba.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="thechineseloveonlineshopping">The Chinese love online shopping.</h4>

<p>China has the world's second largest e-commerce market, with estimates as high as $210 billion for revenues in 2012 and a compound annual growth rate of 120% since 2003. Almost 90% of Chinese electronic retailing occurs on virtual marketplaces. These sprawling e-commerce platforms offer products and services to consumers.</p>

<p>Alibaba is China's leading e-commerce company, operating the world's largest marketplace for both international and domestic Chinese trade. This company is focused on fostering an open, collaborative, and prosperous e-commerce system that benefits consumers, merchants, and the economy.</p>

<p>Alibaba wants to become a more global company. It has already changed the way China shops，and also wants to transform the country's service industry, adding even more users to the company's group of 300 million customers. Alibaba has its sights set firmly on the US market, establishing an investment organization to expand the company's overseas influence and competitiveness. This year, the company has begun the process of an initial public offering in the United States, with economists valuing the company at $110 billion.</p>

<p>If Alibaba has seemed unstoppable in its 15-year rise, an IPO will could make one of the world's most important high-tech companies face its most serious challenges so far. Alibaba's strategy of building its own global e-commerce empire, with its own financial services, has attracted close scrutiny from China's regulators and resistance from the country's banks. Alibaba's executive vice chairman says that the company's strategy has a single focus: to boost Alibaba's core e-commerce platform, especially as consumers shop more on smartphones.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/sina-weibo.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="chinaiskingofsocialmediahowironic">China is king of social media. How ironic.</h4>

<p>China does not have Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube. Yet, China has the world's largest active environment for social media. More than 300 million people use social medial including blogs, social networks, microblogs, online communities, etc. China's Internet users spend more than 40% of their time online for social media, a number that continues to rise rapidly.</p>

<p>Social media began in China around 1994 with online communities and forums, and in 1994, shifted towards instant messaging. Blogging began in 2004, and a year later, social networks with chatting capabilities, such as Ren Ren, were established. In 2009, Sina Weibo launched microblogging with multimedia service.</p>

<p>This explosive growth shows few signs of abating. It is harder for the Chinese government to censor social media than other information channels. Because many Chinese citizens are somewhat skeptical of the authority of governments and formal institutions, users disproportionately respect of opinion leaders on social media.</p>

<p>Sina Weibo is among China's fastest growing and most talked about social media, often referred to as China's Twitter and Facebook. In just four short years, Weibo has attracted over 500 million users, including ordinary people, celebrities, and other public figures, as well as organizations, such as media, businesses, governments, and charities.</p>

<p>However, Weibo confines itself in China, having amassed a huge user base in China and Chinese communities abroad. Besides Sina introducing an English-version of Weibo and allowing users to login through Facebook, Weibo has made no effort in expanding to foreign markets, rather focusing on recruiting users within China. New research suggests that Sina may need to re-consider its strategy: Weibo seems to have peaked in popularity. Weibo's domestic competitor, Tencent's WeChat, poses a threat to Weibo's competitiveness in the social media market.</p>

<p>Tencent's Wechat was first launched in late 2011. During its first two years, WeChat already accumulated over 300 million years. It approaches a completely different strategy than Weibo: going directly to the international market to sell its product. However, Weibo is very massive and popular in China, and also serves as the most active and powerful Chinese platform for public expression.</p>

<p>This year, Sina Weibo fundraised $500 million in preparation for its IPO. Weibo also has the support of Alibaba in the social media market. Alibaba holds an 18% stake in Weibo, having stopped the use of WeChat seller-side services, and allowing Weibo users to directly buy products from Taobao. In addition, from an international perspective, China's Weibo has a greater influence than United-States based Twitter. In fact, Twitter worries that its Chinese counterpart might actually impede its international growth.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/china-flag.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="madeinchinalookslikeatechwinner">"Made in China" looks like a tech winner.</h4>

<p>From the Chinese market perspective of smartphones, e-commerce, and social media, the growth of China's tech industry has been quick and mighty. Web-based products have also been well received by Chinese citizens, enabling domestic businesses to hold a significant market share. Indigenous products are fierce competitors with foreign projects, and Chinese companies, such as Alibaba, have invested heavily in indigenous products to expand their overseas influence and competitiveness.</p>

<p>In terms of the smartphone, e-commerce and social media markets, the Chinese economy and its high-tech sector have not only maintained their rapid growth, but through their clever marketing, design, and business strategies, have also captured international acclaim. However, on the increasingly competitive international market, Chinese companies must devote more sources to research and development to keep up and surpass their foreign rivals.</p>

<p>Chinese tech companies need to realize that their local knowledge is a source of competitive advantage, and take advantage of this type of expertise. Companies with global aspirations need to develop an international brand to promote high-quality and reliable products.</p>

<p>At the end of 2013, China's Internet population reached 618 million, with 81% through mobile. An increasingly connected country provides more opportunities for tech innovation in the likes of Alibaba, Xiaomi and Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>So, what's going to be the next "Made in China" high-tech gadget?</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/01/temp-slug-43/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7aba597c-8a52-4b6a-b968-58c9c80d8570</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 01:04:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hack the Mind By Loving]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Hack the mind by living, laughing, learning, and <strong>loving</strong>.</em></p>

<h2 id="loving">Loving.</h2>

<p>Love is expressed through actions, and experienced through emotions. However, there is no one way to define the essence of love. </p>

<p>Love encompasses sympathy, determination, tolerance, patience, support, confidence and so much more. If a person wants to truly express love, he or she must first learn to love oneself, to love the world, and to love mankind.</p>

<p>If a person wishes for more love in their lives, the person must learn to accept the past. You must not let past things hold you back from finding true love and happiness. Once you have accepted the past, forgive and forget, and move on.</p>

<p>When finding love, one must be open-minded and consider the qualities of a person that does not initially meet the eye. One must remember that no one is perfect, and never close the door on a new opportunity. </p>

<p>Take a fresh look at all the people you encounter in your daily life, and you might discover someone as a love potential. At first, potential may not seem as exciting as love at first sight. However, give this potential time, and it might just blossom into the most stable and beautiful love you have ever experienced.</p>

<p>To love others, you must first learn to love yourself. You should learn how to experience love, build self-confidence, and change your bad habits. Do something good for someone else so that you can become a better person. To respect yourself is to love yourself. Remember that no one in this world perfect. However, if you learn to love yourself, people will notice the change through your behavior and interaction with them. Once you love yourself, then you are worth being loved by others.</p>

<p>Once you begin a relationship, you must learn how to contribute to the relationship because love is shared between two people. Love has its ups and downs. A lover will bring you joy and happiness, but he or she can also hurt you. </p>

<p>If you want true love, you must learn to open your heart and trust your loved one. Do not keep secrets from each other. Do not pretend what you are not. Do not lie to each other. Give your lover the chance to know the real you.</p>

<p>Lastly, you need to give love time. Do not force the feeling of love. Do not hastily rush into relationship. This will only leave you feeling discontent and empty in the relationship. Love takes patience and endurance.</p>

<p><em>Love is waiting. You only need to find it.</em></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>

<p>I know that what I wrote above may be sappy, cliched, or completely unrealistic. But, it is my perception on love.</p>

<p>Having attended my very first wedding this past March, I know that happily ever after is not a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Love takes time, effort, money, and energy. But I believe that if you put everything into a relationship with someone who both your gut, mind, and heart tells you to go after, what do you have to lose on love?</p>

Bitcoin? WTF?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is currency?</strong></p>

<p>Currency refers to the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use. Specifically, the term is synonymous with money in any form that is used or circulated as a viable medium of exchange.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>What is Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized digital currency that relies on cryptography to provide instantaneous peer-to-peer transactions anywhere in the world. Satoshi Nakamoto published the specification for the open-source platform in 2009. Bitcoin’s design is public, nobody owns or controls the virtual currency, and everyone can take part in its development and use.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Um63OQz3bjo'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><strong>Why are people going nuts about Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>There are many advantages to Bitcoin. Its transactions require no bank or clearing house approval. It can be used anywhere as long as you have internet access. Your Bitcoin account cannot be frozen as a result of governmental action. And there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits associated with opening and maintaining a Bitcoin account.</p>

<p><strong>How do I start using Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>Download a Bitcoin wallet! A Bitcoin wallet allows you to transact with other users and gives you ownership of a balance with which you can send and receive Bitcoins. You can install a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, tablet, and/or computer. Desktop wallets give you complete control over your wallet, but you are responsible for protecting your money and performing backups. Mobile wallets allow you to bring Bitcoin with you on-the-go. Web-based wallets allow you to use Bitcoin on any browser or mobile and may provide additional services and support as well.</p>

<p>Once you have your Bitcoin wallet installed, it will generate your first Bitcoin address. You can let your friends know of your Bitcoin address so they can pay you and vice versa. It is like how email works, but Bitcoin addresses are only meant to be used once. Don’t worry, you can always generate another Bitcoin addresses when you need it.</p>

<p><strong>How does a Bitcoin transaction work?</strong></p>

<p>The Bitcoin network relies on the block chain, a shared public ledger that includes all confirmed transactions. Users rely on the block chain to calculate their Bitcoin balance and to verify new transactions. Cryptography is employed to enforce the integrity and  chronology of the block chain.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin-peer-to-peer-network.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>A Bitcoin transaction involves a transfer of values between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets maintain a private key used to sign transactions, providing mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents transactions from being altered by anyone else once they have been issued.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin-wallet-set-address.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>How are Bitcoin transactions processed?</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions are processed through mining, which involves utilizing computer hardware to do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network. These calculations are used to confirm waiting transactions that get included in the block chain.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/GmOzih6I1zs'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Confirmation means that a transaction has been processed and is highly unlikely to be reversible. In order for a transaction to be confirmed, transactions must be packed into a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules, which must then be verified by the network.</p>

<p>As a reward, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees, as well as newly created Bitcoins, for their efforts. Bitcoin mining is a specialized and competitive market where miners are rewarded in proportion to the amount of work they’ve done. Not all Bitcoin users are Bitcoin miners. In fact, the mining market has become quite saturated as Bitcoin prices continue to surge.</p>

Here's why.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/heartbleed.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Earlier this week, a researcher at Google Security and Finnish security firm <a href='http://www.codenomicon.com/' >Codenomicon</a> discovered the <a href='http://heartbleed.com/' >Heartbleed</a> bug in OpenSSL, a widely used open-source software that is used to encrypt sensitive information, like emails, passwords and credit card numbers.</p>

<p>Because of the Heartbleed bug, a huge chunk of the Internet is vulnerable to cyber attacks. So with one attack, a hacker can grab 64kb of memory from a server and leave no trace of ever doing so. Imagine how much information can be accessed over repeatable exploits. Scary? No, this is <strong>catastrophic</strong>.</p>

<p>Apparently, this security flaw in OpenSSL has been around for 2 years, affecting over 2/3 of sites and services, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Yahoo, that depend on OpenSSL for encryption. According to security expert, <a href='https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html' >Bruce Schneier</a>, "On the scale of 1 to 10, this [Heartbleed] is an 11."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The Heartbleed Bug effectively means past SSL traffic can be decrypted, unless it used Perfect Forward Secrecy. <a href='http://t.co/PCREwSltRJ' >http://t.co/PCREwSltRJ</a> ಠ_ಠ</p>&mdash; Mathias Bynens (@mathias) <a href='https://twitter.com/mathias/statuses/453380256540663808' >April 8, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src='http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'  charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In other words, the Heartbleed bug comprises your privacy online - big time. All your past, present, and future communications on at least half a million sites can be <strong>seen by anyone.</strong> Even with Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled, your past data is still vulnerable.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/heartbleed-xkcd.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>As programmers around the world are busy patching up their systems with a bug-free version of OpenSSL, the best thing for you to do to protect your data online is to <strong>change your passwords IMMEDIATELY.</strong> You can also test for your vulnerability at afflicted sites <a href='http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/' >here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="asmallrantontheweather">A Small Rant on the Weather.</h4>

<p>North Carolina is known for its awesomely bipolar weather.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/durham-cloudy.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>About a week ago, the weather was close to the freezing point. This week, Durham decided to skip spring and jump straight into summer.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/durham-sunny.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>I'm actually really cool with that - except all angiosperms on campus decided to flower - and that means pollen...pollen everywhere.</p>

<h4 id="withaprilcomesallergiesandmore">With April comes allergies and more...</h4>

<p>Besides the incessant amount of pollen abound, April will be even crazier than March.</p>

<p>First off, it's going to be my last semester in college. <strong>MY LAST SEMESTER.</strong> This is unbelievable. These past four years have been gone in the blink of an eye. I am both excited and terrified that I will be attending my own graduation in a month.</p>

<p>In April, I plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create my own infectious disease that could potentially wipe out the entire human population</li>
<li>Attend <a href='http://bases.stanford.edu/e-bootcamp/' >Entrepreneurship Bootcamp</a> at Stanford University with other like-minded student entrepreneurs from all over the world</li>
<li>Celebrate my very last day of classes at Duke EDM (electronic dance music) style with Dillon Francis</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="newstuffcoming">New stuff coming.</h4>

<p>I admit that I have not been publishing on a regular schedule. I have been brainstorming and writing.</p>

<p>Some things to look forward to in the upcoming months:</p>

<ul>
<li>The last post in my Hack the Mind series on love. </li>
<li>Exploring the movie <em>Her</em>>and falling in love with an artificially intelligent being</li>
<li>What makes the best mobile apps so addicting</li>
<li><em>Hatching Twitter</em> and the drama of starting the company of 140 characters</li>

<h2 id="learning">Learning.</h2>

<p>Seriously, learning is the best way to not only exercise your brain but also a chance for you to <strong>invest in yourself.</strong></p>

<p>Education will enable you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become more aware of what goes on in the world</li>
<li>Discover and develop your passion</li>
<li>Provide you with the tools and strategies to help you get ahead of the game</li>
</ul>

<p>College has been my academic playground. Since day one at Duke, I made it my goal to discover what I would be truly passionate about.</p>

<p>Finding out what I wanted to do with my life was no easy task. I considered at least over ten majors (from biomedical engineering to classical studies), took classes in a broad array of subjects, and explored many potential career paths.</p>

<p>Along the way, I made mistakes, but I learned more about myself with each new educational opportunity that I pursued.</p>

<p>Although I decided to declare a double major in biology and computer science near the end of my sophomore year, I didn't know what I wanted to do this degree until the first semester of my senior year.</p>

<p>Last semester, I decided to take a break from my extracurricular activities and invest my time learning about startups and companies in Silicon Valley. By doing so, I realized that there was more to the tech industry than just being a software developer.</p>

<p>I caught the startup bug. I discovered a new frontier of creativity and innovation that lay in the heart of my most favorite city in the world: San Francisco.</p>

<p>I love to code and I love to build. I have greater ambitions than just coding and building. I want to learn how to channel my creativity to impact the world. And I want to learn how to utilize my passion for technology to create innovative products for people to lead healthy, productive, and exciting lives.</p>

<p>I don't know where life will take me, but I know that all the learning opportunities that I pursued at Duke have brought me to where I am today. I want to create and innovate, and my studies at Duke have provided me with the skills and toolset to do so.</p>

<p>Near the conclusion of my college career, I have finally discovered what I want to do with my life. And I will make learning my lifelong endeavor to turn my ultimate dreams and aspirations into reality.</p>

<p>I once received an email from a professor at Duke who wrote that she learned best by investing in her <em>time</em> and <em>money</em>. I agree wholeheartedly. Attending Duke University and pursuing two majors in the STEM fields are two of the best decisions I have made in my life.</p>

<p>I will keep on learning. I will continue to put my learning to good use. I will continue to invest myself through learning.</p>

<h2 id="laughing">Laughing.</h2>

<p>LOL (laughing out loud) is the three letter acronym that has been incorporated into my vernacular.</p>

<p>Laughing is the best way to convey your happiness and to release stress. It will help you lift the burden from your shoulders and free you from your worries.</p>

<p>Reseach on laughter has shown that laughter can help keep our bodies strong and disease resistant. A good laugh exercises many muscles in your face and causes the brain to release endorphins, which will elevate your mood and make you happy.</p>

<p>Simply put, laughing improves your longevity, thus giving you even more chances to pursue the life that you have always envisioned. The positive side effects of laughter include reduced blood pressure, decreased blood glucose, the dulling of pain, the alleviation of stress and anxiety, and an improved feeling of well being.</p>

<p>Listen up, especially for you fitness fanatics out there, laughing will help you burn those calories. A healthy laugh session can be equal to a couple of minutes on an exercising machine. In addition, when you laugh, you are also conditioning your diaphragm, abdominals, respiratory, facial, leg and back muscles. Now that's a workout you can do without a drop of sweat!</p>

<p>Laughing can help you feel and look better. So why not turn that frown upside down, and laugh out loud?</p>

<p>And if you want a laughing challenge, try ROFL (rolling on floor laughing) and LMFAO (laughing my #$@! <em>beep</em> off).</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/03/15/hack-the-mind-by-laughing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c754710b-da6d-47a3-b998-272beaba00ae</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 15:31:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hack the Mind By Living]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Hack your mind by <strong>living</strong>, laughing, learning, and loving.</em></p>

<h2 id="living">Living.</h2>

<p>Honestly, live! You only live once (#yolo), so why not live life to the fullest?</p>

<p>Don't let your inhibitions and doubts hope you back from fulfilling your dreams and reaching your potential. From personal experience, I can affirm that it is so much better to live a life of "oh wells" than "what ifs."</p>

<p>Living is the reason that I decided to jump off a plane and go skydiving. Living is the reason that despite facing a huge mountain of debt, I still plan on a month long trip to Europe after college graduation.</p>

<p>I know I probably just threw a lot of mundane, cliched phrases at you, but think again. If people say these things over and over again, there must be some truth to them, right?</p>

<p>You only have one life to live, so live life to the fullest. Chase your dreams, set high ambitions, and never doubt yourself.</p>

<p>I expect to face far greater social challenges than technical ones as I prepare to enter the tech industry. But I have come to realize that the greatest obstacle to accomplishing your goals is having a negative mindset. I need to be assertive about what I want in my life.</p>

<p>I should not wait for things in my life to happen. I should make them happen.</p>

<p>Eleanor Roosevelt once said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I try my best to not worry about what others think about me. My time is better well spent living my own life and spending my time with the friends and family that truly care about me.</p>

<p>As long as you set your mind to live the impossible, then you can live the impossible. And if you find that others are an impediment on your path of success, try to navigate around them with a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Life has its ups and downs, and it may not always be like how you envisioned. But, push yourself to make your life how you want it to be.</p>

<p>Live like you're shooting for the moon. And even if you miss, you will still land among the stars!</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/03/15/hack-the-mind-by-living/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">bda45f4b-4210-46cf-9344-025896554688</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 15:26:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Are Some Mobile Apps So Addicting?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/unsplash_528c8f581f45e_1.JPG'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Today's technology market is mobile-centric. Mobile apps have become an integral part of our smartphone-driven lives. They connect us to our social networks whenever and wherever. They enable us to outsource our most mind-numbing questions to the wisdom of the crowds. They provide us with on-demand access to hail taxis and to stream movies. From serving as pocket readers to personal assistants, mobile apps have fundamentally changed the way we interact with people and the way we manage our daily lives.</p>

<p>With so many mobile apps in the market, what makes the best stand out from the masses? What qualities make apps so addictive, while others are left to rot on the digital shelf? How do apps provide a thrilling user experience? How do they improve consumer productivity? How do the best mobile apps deliver the solution to the problem they were made to solve?</p>

<p>The answer lies in product design. Specifically, product design that enables the building of habit-forming mobile apps.</p>

<p>Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and the Functionalist school of industrial design. The answers to his question <a href='https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design' >"Is my design good design?</a> form what is often referred to as the Ten Commandants of design.</p>

<p>In this next series of posts on technology, we will explore what makes product design, good product design. We will look at some of the most popular and addicting mobile apps on the market in relation to Dieter Rams' Ten Commandants of design.</p>

<p>How do addicting apps keep us wanting for more? Stay tuned to find out.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/02/18/addicting-apps/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e0f94a10-e6c5-4d92-85a6-016659eb6c4d</guid><category><![CDATA[Product]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2014 12:00:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contemplating About Life After College in 2014]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/unsplash_52b11a38ccf91_1.JPG'  alt="" /></p>

<p>A friend of mine recently graduated from college, and will be finishing his last semester abroad. He texted me that studying abroad would mark the beginning of his life after college. He wanted to have a great experience by starting a new chapter in his life, However, he also did not want to leave everything he knew behind, and he was not sure what the consequences would be if he did so.</p>

<p>His thoughts made me reminisce about my childhood. In my twenty-one years of life, I have lived through many “chapters” of life. Most of them were short, consisting of two to three years at most. Almost all started when I attended a new school and ended with my moving to another city. Each time, I picked up my bags and moved, I remembered the feeling of wanting to start anew, to change a little something about myself, and to fashion myself in a completely new way to unknown strangers. In the process, I would leave my past (including childhood friends and a little part of myself) behind.</p>

<p>There were both pros and cons to moving around every so often. It was fun getting the opportunity to reinvent myself. It was exciting getting to live in a new environment. I enjoyed the exhilaration of new people and new places.</p>

<p>Yet, there was no social media back then to help me stay in touch with old childhood friends. I had to rebuild social networks from scratch through in-person communication with real people. I spent so much time meeting and spending time with new people that I forgot to keep in touch with old friends.</p>

<p>I now suffer the consequences of not having been able (and not really making the effort) to stay in touch with old friends from my pre-college days. I do not have a “group” I can come back home to hang out with during winter breaks and summer vacations. I have grown accustomed to the changes that came with moving from one place to another.</p>

<p>In fact, I take pride knowing that my independence is rooted in my ability to easily adapt to new situations and places. I am sociable and outgoing, but part of me always feels lonely. Because I have already encountered so much change in my life, because my life has been jumbled up and pieced back together so many times, when I look do back, I do not have anything concrete to look back to.</p>

<p>This spring will be my last semester at Duke University. After college graduation, I will be moving back to San Francisco, the place where I spent most of my adolescence growing up around the bay. Even though I will be moving back to the place I have learned to call home, my world will once again be uprooted. I am lucky to have my family here, but I will be entering a brave new world of the tech industry. I’m excited. I’m scared. I fear for what lies ahead. But at least I am more emotionally mature to handle whatever life throws at me, and that means not leaving behind whatever remains from my childhood and the happy memories of my college years.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/01/23/life-after-college-in-2014/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">05b70057-7257-4294-a50e-e83eb820292e</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 15:21:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Goodbye, 2013. Hello, 2014.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/unsplash_527e864de3770_1.JPG'  alt="" /></p>

<p>2013 was an extremely interesting year.</p>

<p>In 2013, I lost and found myself. On January, 1, 2013, in the aftermath of an euphoric night dancing to the electronic sounds of disk-jockey Dash Berlin, without even realizing,  a part of me plummeted deep within, buried alive in the deepest crevices of my mind. Sometime during the middle of 2013, I journeyed to that deep crevice, and discovered my greatest fear: empty happiness. The rest of 2013 was a journey to not only escape but conquer that fear, to fix the broken pieces and become at one with myself again.</p>

<p>In 2013, I fell in love with what I had missed growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area. My passion dangled like a carrot in front of my eyes, but I was too blind to see it. In the past four years, I flew across the country too many times and explored countless subjects, but my endeavors were not conducted in vain. There is a reason that the turtle, and not the rabbit won the race. My gut feelings told me that each step would gradually take me to my final destination. Now, all I can say is that when you finally know what you want out of life, you truly understand what 20/20 foresight and hindsight vision feels like. Looking backwards, everything I did made sense. Looking forwards, I am ready to tackle what I have set my heart out to do.</p>

<p>In 2013, I became obsessed with technology and electronic dance music. I am addicted to TechCrunch, Fast Company, Kaskade, TyDi, Crunchbase, Wired, Dash Berlin, VentureBeat, Mashable, Dada Life, etc. No tech, no EDM for 24 hours, my brain goes into an immediate state of withdrawal. Innovation, creativity, and ideas in the form of technology and electronic dance music spark my drive. Thus it makes sense that if the source is removed, I wither.</p>

<p>In 2013, my twenty-one years of linear thinking has been shattered. Life does not consist of discrete units. It is a continuous, unpredictable flow. For the first time in my life, I am content with not knowing what the future holds. By changing my mindset, I felt a heavy weight lifted off my shoulders. This does not mean that I have decided to live a life of complete spontaneity. Instead, I tune out distractions and direct my life to encounter serendipity.</p>

<p>At the end of 2013, as the clock was about to strike midnight,  I was calmed by the realization that I have conquered everything life threw at me in the past 365 days.</p>

<p>As 2013 ends, and 2014 begins, I begin the rest of my life.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/01/23/goodbye-2013-hello-2014/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">f28983de-d758-46d8-8155-e55ad4174f9d</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 14:52:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beautiful Technology: The Secret Is Design]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/unsplash_52b6b4db7397c_1.JPG'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Technology is awesome. It makes our lives easier, enabling us to be more productive in the limited twenty-four hours of the day. It helps us to stay in touch with our social networks, easing and bridging the communication gap created by distance. It helps us to learn more about ourselves, enabling us to lead healthier lives and and make more well-informed decisions based on personal data.</p>

<p>However, in the end, it is a technology's design that motivates us to explore its functionality. As humans, we are attracted to beauty. We love the sleek, the sexy and the elegant.</p>

<p>Design is a significant contributor to technology. It defines a product's aesthetics and utility. Design is a state of mind and an approach to a problem. Think along the lines of Apple, Path, Square, Airbnb, Uber, and Jawbone. In order to create and establish timeless brands, these companies use design to forge the identity of their products. As quoted from startupsthisishowdesignworks.com, "the perfect balance of business, tech, and design is an incredibly powerful tool ... and an even more powerful business model."</p>

<p>Love is a powerful emotion. Designers take great lengths to create products that customers will <em>fall in love with</em>.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/01/23/beautiful-technology/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">85e11993-9f68-4660-8944-14dc01cc0072</guid><category><![CDATA[Product]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 12:00:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Note on User Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/tumblr_mzzqxabKjH1st5lhmo1_1280.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Don’t judge a book by its cover. Let’s apply this statement to digital interfaces: mobile apps, websites, web applications…anything that you find on a screen. It’s wrong.</p>

<p><strong>For a digital product, its “cover” defines its identity.</strong> The interface is the only viable means of communication between the designer and the user. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the designer creates an interface with obvious purpose and utility. The best interfaces are simple, minimalist, and intuitive: one that avoids feature creeps and provides the user with a fluid, painless experience.</p>

<p>Failure to do so results in the user forming an incorrect mental conception of the product, leading to confusion, errors, and decrease levels of user engagement. In fact, if the designer fails to convey the value proposition of the product through the user interface, how is the business expected to generate revenue, let alone retain customers?</p>

<p>In his book, <em>The Design of Everyday Things,</em> Donald A. Norman describes four crucial aspects of physical product design that can easily be extended to the design of digital interfaces.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Natural Mapping:</strong> Take advantage of physical analogies and cultural standards to convey the relationship between a control and its resulting function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perceived Affordances:</strong> Utilize the perceived action of a device or object to emphasize its intended action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedback:</strong> After a user interacts with the interface, be sure to present the effect of the action in a clear and concise format.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constraints:</strong> Incorporate forcing functions to prevent errors that may arise from user experience.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Simplicity and ease of use could determine the “make it or break it” point of your digital product.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2013/12/23/an-aside-on-user-experience/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">bd61ec37-dfa8-459d-bb99-0a87b16602f0</guid><category><![CDATA[Product]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2013 03:40:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Modern Musical Innovations of the 20th Century (part two)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In part two of this post series, we will explore the modern musical innovations rooted in the curation and juxtaposition of diverse instrumental and electronic sounds. These six composers sought to liberate sound in all its beauty and aesthetic glory, enabling music to achieve an entirely novel form of sonic freedom.</p>

<p><strong>1. Aaron Copland: <em>Hoedown</em> from <em>Rodeo</em> (1942)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5xdS05COSEA39fom0Dr1Dj'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>During the 1930s, the musical genre of jazz was experiencing a tremendous period of creativity, yet American composers were still searching for an authentic American style. Copland attempts to capture the American spirit in <em>Hoedown</em> from <em>Rodeo</em>. His concern with the role of a composer in society led him to not only write sonatas for violin, piano, and other orchestra instruments, but also a number of contemporary musical currents, big ballets, and symphonies using American folklore and American subjects.</p>

<p><strong>2. Elliot Carter: <em>Sonata for Cello</em> (1948)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5raRRF9I2SPFwLve91c4Fp'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Following the death of Anton Webern, serial music became much more disseminated, and was widely viewed as the "path to new music." Total serialism is the radical notion that the composer applies the notion of series to not only pitch but also to successions of rhythms, dynamics, and timbre. In addition, the advent of electronic means of music production enabled the precise control of impossible complex rhythms and shifts of timbre. Although Carter initially composed mature pieces in the neoclassical tonality, he eventually embarked on a career of marked musical innovation. He gave attention to the technical features of his music, particularly metric modulation, which involves gradual changes in tempo, eventually resulting in its constant fluctuation. The first movement of <em>Sonata for Cello</em> illustrates Carter's emphasis on atonality and rhythmic complexity; musically speaking, as the piano walks, the cello swims.</p>

<p><strong>3. Charles Ives: <em>The Unanswered Question</em> (1906, revision between 1930-1935)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:03IlWexscleuidLPOppBLg'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p><em>The Unanswered Question</em> is an exemplary work of collage music in which Ives showcases his ability to marry the consonant with the dissonant. In the background of slow quiet strings that represent "The Silence of the Druids," a solo trumpet poses the "The Perennial Question of Existence" to which a woodwind quartet of "Fighting Answers" vainly attempts to provide an answer, growing more frustrated and agitated. When the woodwinds finally give up, the trumpet poses the question silently one last time, its sound fading into the backdrop of slow, solemn lines of the strings. <em>The Unanswered Question</em> heavily influenced John Adam's <em>On the Transmigration of Souls</em>, which will explored next.</p>

<p><strong>4. John Adams: <em>On the Transmigration of Souls</em> (2002)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6EFAKtulkpjjOqE9XwjTzj'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Similar to Ives' <em>The Unanswered Question,</em> Adam's <em>On the Transmigration of Souls</em> is a college piece that effortlessly blends in the sounds of orchestra, chorus, children's choir, and pre-recorded tape. The Pulitzer-winning composition, initially commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, serves to create a "memory space", a place where listeners can go and be alone with their thoughts and emotions. Although it was written to commemorate the 9/11 attacks, Adam believes that the piece summons a human experience that goes beyond this particular tragic event in history. The word 'transmigration' in this piece does not only point to the transition from the living to the dead, but also the change which took place within the souls that were left behind, of those who suffer pain and loss when accepting the passing of their loved ones. Adam was heavily influenced by Ives when he created the spiritual model that embodies this particular piece of composition. <em>On the Transmigration of Souls</em> does not exploit emotions, but instead concentrates on the loss and grief experienced by those left behind to deal with the ramifications of the 9/11 tragedy.</p>

<p><strong>5. Karlheinz Stockhausen: <em>Gesang der Junglinge</em> (1956)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0Y9DYv05QW8Cs8UTrXnRnA'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>The advent of novel musical technologies for sound synthesis permitted not only the introduction of new musical instruments but also paved the way for new ways of experiencing music. Stockhausen's <em>Gesang der Junglinge</em> uses both synthesized sounds and modified recordings of a boy soprano voice in serialized levels of intelligibility. He believed that the direction and movement of the sounds is shaped by the musician, whose function is to open up a new dimension in musical experience through the liberation of sound. <em>Gesang der Junglinge</em> is a composition, that for the first time, brought together the two opposing worlds of purely electronically generated German <em>Elektronische Musik</em> and the French <em>Musique Concrete</em>.</p>

<p><strong>6. Gyorgy Ligeti: <em>Poeme Symphonique for 100 Metronomes</em> (1962) and <em>Etudes, Book I, Fanfares</em> (1985)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1aFYkQBSXgAeNFQYHWNnOQ'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Although the middle period of Ligeti's works clearly demonstrated the lessons of the electronic studio being applied to instrumental music, his later innovations revealed his pursuit of the avant-garde. On the one hand, his <em>Poeme Symphonique for 100 Metronomes</em> showcases his musical experimentations in the Fluxus movement, which sought to blend different artistic media and disciplines. In the performance of this composition, metronomes are set up on a performance platform, all are wound up to their maximum extent and set to different speeds. Once fully wound, there is a silence of two to six minutes, then at the conductor's signal, they are all started as simultaneously as possible. As the metronomes wind down one after another and stop, periodicity becomes noticeable in the sound, and individual metronomes can be clearly distinguished. The piece typically ends with just one metronome ticking alone for a few beats, and then is followed by silence. On the other hand, Ligeti's <em>Etudes</em> is regarded as one of the most creative achievements of his last decades, and one of the most significant sets of 20th century piano studies, combining virtuoso technical problems with expressive content. In <em>Fanfares</em>, the melody and accompaniment frequently exchanges roles in a unique polyrhythmic fashion.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2013/12/21/modern-musical-innovations-of-the-20th-century-part-two/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50819f7a-5510-40f9-a488-58f1f7b5cd32</guid><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2013 09:53:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Modern Musical Innovations of the 20th Century (part one)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This past semester at Duke University, as part of my liberal arts education curriculum, I had the opportunity to study modern music. The novel musical innovations of composers in the twentieth century have redefined and transformed the sonic landscape. Whether its through the usage of unorthodox compositional techniques, the liberation of dissonance, or the application of electronic sounds, these composers have expertly achieved new musical freedom. The late Nelson Mandela once said that "to overthrow oppression is the highest aspiration of every man." Indeed, music is a vehicle that has enabled man to fulfill that aspiration. Part One explores the musical innovations of six influential figures who have either transformed classical music composition or paved the way for the popularization and proliferation of jazz music.</p>

<p><strong>1. Claude Debussy: <em>La Soiree dans Grenade</em> (1903)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1JIiYqWIl48UN5YggA8r2p'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p><em>La Soiree dans Grenade, * from Debussy's *Estampes</em>, is a composition written for solo piano that embodies the composer's talents in musical expression, harmony, and formal freedom. In this piece, Debussy uses the Arabic scale and mimics guitar strumming to evoke fluid and sensual images of Granada, Spain. He believed that the established compositions of his time stood in the way of musical composition, and the musical innovations in this piece reveals his efforts to turn the tide against musical artifice and cliche. <em>La Soiree dans Grenade</em> takes the listener on a trip through Grenade, and admirably conveys the imagery of the Spanish landscape and culture.</p>

<p><strong>2. Anton Webern: <em>Six Pieces for Orchestra</em> (1909) and <em>Variations for Piano</em> (1936)</strong></p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3GibeYiwdW39JYrbn7UMwA'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Expressionism is an artistic movement that seeks not to depict objective reality, but rather the subjective emotions and responses that objects and events arouse in the artist. Webern's <em>Six Pieces for Orchestra</em>, is an exemplary composition from this era, highlighting his skills as a miniaturist as he crams fierce and grand lines into the tiniest of musical spaces. Following the footsteps of Arnold Schoenberg's <em>Five Pieces for Orchestra</em>, Webern liberates dissonance, enabling the expressive possibilities of different silences to rival that of intervening sounds. <em>Six Pieces for Orchestra</em> is a requiem for Webern's mother, capturing the various emotional states that the composer experienced as he mourned for his loss. The fourth movement is a funeral march: the terrible sounds the listener hears at the conclusion of the movement compellingly evokes the anger Webern felt when confronted with the passing of his mother.</p>

<iframe src='https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1Z7KTdKuQrUNKZIIaOJTSw'  width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Webern's <em>Variations for Piano</em>, on the other hand, is a work that represents the composer's technical expertise in the twelve-tone technique. In the second movement, Webern utilizes symmetry as a compositional principle, introducing a novel sonic organization of chromaticism. Webern's contemporary, Schoenberg asserted the need for "laws to justify the dissonant character of these harmonics and their successions," and the second movement of <em>Variations for Piano</em> is just one of many stylistic variations that arose from the development of serialism.</p>

<p><strong>3. Igor Stravinsky: <em>the Rite of Spring</em> (1913), <em>Mass</em> (1944-48), and <em>Requiem Canticles</em>(1968)</strong></p>

<p>Stravinsky is one of the most prolific composers of the modern musical era. At a young age, he was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, the founder of Ballets Russes, to compose a series of Russian ballet symphonies, including <em>the Rite of Spring</em>, <em>Petrushka</em>, and the <em>Firebird</em> propelling him into the musical spotlight in the early 1910s. Stravinsky's ballet symphonies featured irregular rhythms, changing meters emanating from Russian language accents, and the composer's wonderful mastery of the orchestra. Most importantly, Stravinsky's rhythmic innovations and the primacy of rhythm as form was recognized as musically revolutionary.</p>

<p>The composer's later works, <em>Sanctus</em> from <em>Mass</em> and <em>Des Irae</em> from the Requiem Canticles, reveal his compositional endeavors in Neoclassicism and late serialism, respectively. On the one hand, <em>Sanctus</em> reflects the neoclassical, anti-Romantic aesthetic and expression of liturgical themes, depicting music not only as a public ritual but also an invocation of the private spiritual realm. On the other, <em>Des Irae</em> is Stravinsky's last completed work that he nicknamed the "Pocket Requiem," featuring a serial style performed by a speaking chorus juxtaposed among singing soloists.</p>

<p><strong>4. Paul Hindemith: <em>Kammermusic No.5 for Viola and Ensemble</em> (1923)</strong></p>

<p>New Classicism in Berlin, Germany during the post-World War I era, exemplified a new artistic spirit that marked a reinterpretation of older, classical forms. As opposed to the musical experimentation of pre-War times, composers like Hindemith sought for clarity, utility, and control of abstraction in their pieces. The solo viola lines in <em>Kammermusik No.5 for Viola and Ensemble</em> sounds almost Neo-Bachian; Hindemith's composition is reminiscent of the classical baroque periods, but adds a novel sonic twist to suit the listening tastes of a modern audience.</p>

<p><strong>5. Duke Ellington: <em>Cottontail</em>（1940)</strong></p>

<p>Duke Ellington's <em>Cottontail</em> features the "rhythm changes" or chordal progressions of George Gershwin's jazz standard "I Got Rhythm." <em>Cottontail</em> follows the style of bebop, the new intellectual musical language of the Roaring Twenties. Bebop placed emphasis on small combinations of players (i.e. quartets and quintets) over big bands, featured spontaneous composition, and required incredible skills in improvisation to play. Although the genre of bebop was not very popular among audience members, it paved the way for the development of swing-like jazz standards such as <em>Cottontail.</em></p>

<p><strong>6. Miles Davis: <em>Jeru</em> (1949), <em>So What</em> (1959),and <em>Spanish Key</em> (1970)</strong></p>

<p>Duke Ellington describes Miles Davis as the Picasso of jazz music; Davis was known for his radical innovations, utilization of technology, and new musical discoveries in harmony and melody. He welded a constant desire to forge ahead, pioneering modal jazz, hard bop, modal music, and his own unusual brand of avant-garde and fusion jazz.</p>

<p><em>Jeru</em> from <em>Birth of the Cool</em> is an exemplary work of cool jazz, featuring slower, relaxed tempos, a greater concern with texture, and elements of classical music. Davis developed cool jazz as a counterforce to bebop; the former focused on the formal and subtle, while the latter emphasized spontaneity and flamboyant. In general, <em>Birth of the Cool</em> is characterized by its unusual instrumentation, innovative musical arrangements that highlights polyphony, and an expressive, light sound.</p>

<p>Ten years later, the harmonic framework of <em>So What</em> from <em>Kind of Blue</em> marks a shift from the use of chordal progressions to musical modes in jazz music. In <em>So What</em>, the listener can experience the musician's improvisation over a single modal center. As demonstrated in <em>So What</em>, the creation of solos, accompaniments, and compositions centers around slow-moving harmonic rhythms, quantal harmonies or melodies, and polytonality in modal jazz.</p>

<p>With the rise of new musical production technologies in the 1960s and 1970s, Davis began to experiment with electric instruments and the application of the studio as a musical instrument in his avant-garde fusion jazz. In <em>Spanish Key</em> of <em>Bitches Brew</em>, Davis, while incorporating the sounds of electric piano and guitars in his tracks, rejects traditional notions of jazz in favor of a looser, more experimental rock-influenced improvisational style.</p>
