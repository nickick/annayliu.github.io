Take a note of what's next.”]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>About 15 fifteen years ago, the founders of Google sought to make even the most obscure of information accessible to anyone at the touch of a button. Today, the search giant seeks to make information available directly at the line of sight.</p>

<p>From its privacy-intrusion capabilities to an Android-based platform geared for innovation, Google Glass presents a new paradigm for how humans interact with technology. Despite the device’s disruptive potential for augmented reality, Glass has garnered equal amounts of ridicule and fear as respect and curiosity from society. The wearable tech’s biggest hindrance to its mainstream adoption is not technical, but social: to convince people to wear Glass.</p>

<p>So how should Google go about in making Glass the future of wearable technology in obtaining the mainstream adoption of the device?</p>

<h4 id="stopdesigningglassfornerds">Stop designing Glass for nerds.</h4>

<p>As sci-fi as Glass currently looks, the device arouses as much as curiosity as it does in <a href='http://www.wired.com/2013/12/glasshole/' >making people feel awkward and uncomfortable</a>.  Although there are limited units of Glass released to the public, Glass has received so much negative public reaction that the technology really poses an unnecessary, and potentially dangerous, ‘us vs. them’ mentality in society. Despite some claims that the Explorers program has more or less been Google’s social experiment, the search giant needs to take an Apple-like approach in designing future prototypes of Glass for an inevitably, ever-increasing user base. In developing a novel Google-level concept of design, the company needs to make Glass such that the value that the device brings for its user trumps any notion of privacy and security concerns. To garner mainstream adoption of Glass, Google needs to make Glass into a product that people will fall in love with. That is no easy job for a company that places technical expertise over design, but <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/ray-ban-maker-to-work-with-google-on-google-glass-eyewear' >its recent strategic partnership with Luxottica</a>, an Italian firm that makes eyewear for the likes of Ray-Ban, Prada, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, is an excellent start in making Glass fashionably trendy. </p>

<h4 id="viralmarketthepotentialbenefitsofglasstechnologyusers">Viral market the potential benefits of Glass technology users.</h4>

<p>At the 2012 Google I/O conference, the search giant made very strategic moves in announcing one of its most secretive projects to the public and establishing the Google Glass Explorers Program, first for developers, and then for selected consumers. With Glass, Google is pushing the frontiers of wearable technology, and in the spirit of the lean product development, has recognized the need to ignite conversations in order to obtain invaluable customer feedback from early adopters. Although the Explorer Program has revealed a variety of use cases for Glass, the company needs to make a greater marketing effort in showcasing how Glass will benefit humanity on a very personal, if not case-by-case, basis. The Glass platform clearly unveils the device’s potential to designers and developers in terms of creating unique, highly customized user experiences, but Google needs to clearly demonstrate how Glass technology will enrich the lives of its future users. Otherwise, current widespread concerns of Glass’ threats to consumer and privacy will stifle mainstream adoption of the wearable device.</p>

<h4 id="preparetheworldforafutureofubiquitouscomputingandwearabletechnologytoday">Prepare the world for a future of ubiquitous computing and wearable technology, today.</h4>

<p>A world where everyone wears Google Glass will be a much different world than it is today. Even the limited release of Glass today has challenged consumer notions of privacy and security, and the search giant can no longer afford to ignore the ethical, legal, and social ramifications of its highly disruptive technology. A future predominated by ubiquitous computing and wearable technology, such as Glass, is inevitable. Google needs to take efforts in preparing and educating the masses for that future, if not at least for obtaining the mainstream adoption of Glass.</p>

<p>“O.K., Glass. Google will you be the future of wearable technology?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that appears to be the brave new world.”</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/04/o-k-glass-whats-next/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">0c38d3f8-e301-428b-8407-20590f0cb4c7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 02:14:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“OK, Glass. Google how are you going to get people to wear you?”]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Ubiquitous computing makes its possible for the user to access the computer and Internet everywhere and anywhere. The Glass technology is Google’s dream in turning this hands-free computing idea into reality. Although Google has already solved some of the hardest technical challenges associated with Glass, its biggest problem is not technological, but rather behavioral: <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/technology/google-looks-to-make-its-computer-glasses-stylish.html?_r=0' >how to get the average Joe to actually wear the futuristic headset</a>.</p>

<p>Glass is a completely new type of computing device because it changes the fundamental way that humans use computers, shifting the interaction paradigm from touch to voice. Glass is wearable, designed to reduce distraction commonly associated with laptops and smartphones, and created to seamlessly integrate in the daily routines of its user. As described in <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates' >an intimate product review from the Verge</a>, Glass is the “anti-smartphone, explicitly fashioned to blow apart our notions of how we interact with technology.” </p>

<p>Google’s Glass Explorer Program was originally purposed to <a href='http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/faq/' >explore a broad spectrum of user interaction</a> that the wearable tech could potentially provide. Since its launch in April 2013, <a href='http://annayliu.com/Program' http://www.google.com/glass/start/explorer-stories/">the program has showcased a wide variety of innovative user applications</a>, ranging from wildlife conservation of endangered species to providing firefighters a hands-free means to work more efficiently and safely.  Although Glass has proven itself to be quite a useful and promising technology in providing significant benefits to human lives in niche situations, some claim that the Explorer Program “wasn’t much of a product rollout as <a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarunwadhwa/2014/04/24/the-google-glass-explorer-program-was-a-social-experiment-that-backfired/' >it was a social experiment</a>.”  In other words, Google, as part of its marketing strategy, released a prototype into the human jungle to simply see how society would react to Glass.</p>

<p>Yet no matter how disruptive Glass may seem in changing the way humans currently interact with computing devices, Google still needs to push heavily for mainstream adoption of Glass. The designers of Glass are quick to point out that since the advent of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, human beings have begun to spend the majority of their time looking through a lens or down at a screen. That is a big problem, but it is not entirely a new type of problem. Humans have been distracted by new technologies before and found ways to manage that distraction (think radios and driving a car). Thus, in order for Google to successfully tackle the Goliath of Glass’ challenges, the search company must embrace both design and empathy in developing a piece of wearable technology that seamlessly integrates with human senses. </p>

<p>The search company needs to prove to each and every human being that Glass will not only significantly improve the way we run our daily lives, but will also connect us to our friends and family in the most natural – and most social – way possible. Now that is an ambitious task, considering how difficult it is to change human behavior on a widespread scale.</p>

<p>Supporters of Glass assert that that its transformative potential rests in its basis as a wearable device, but when discussing the social implications of the technology, argue that its functionality is no different than that of a smartphone. Luckily for me, I had the opportunity to explore this debate firsthand. I managed to secure a Google Glass from my tech-savvy computer science professor. Through a five-day trial of the futuristic headset, I wanted to experience for myself the alluring possibilities that Glass holds and what it currently brings, and what it could potentially bring, to a user that a smartphone simply could not.</p>

<h4 id="okglasstakeapicture">“OK, Glass. Take a picture.”</h4>

<p>(That was the very first command I gave to my Glass unit. Therefore, it deserves special status as a title of a section in this post.)</p>

<h4 id="okglassshowmewhatsgood">“OK, Glass. Show me what’s good.”</h4>

<p>Simply taking Google Glass out of its box was a pristine moment. After linking Glass to my Google account, I was taken to the timeline, the main user interface comprised of 640 x 360 pixels cards representing events in the past, present, and future. My main interaction with this UI was through the touchpad on the side of Glass. When I scrolled to the right of the Glass clock card, I was presented with the history section that comprised of static cards displaying text, images, and video content. After scrolling to the left of the Glass clock card, I ventured into the present and future section of the timeline, displaying cards that presented me with relevant information pertaining to the current moment, like the time and weather.</p>

<p>Starting Glass with the timeline experience is a clever strategy to transition long-term smartphone users to the wearable technology, without having users abandon their accustomed methods of tactile interaction with computing devices. For me, at least, having the same notifications that I would receive on the smartphone delivered straight to my face via Glass felt imposing. Also, the process of adapting to UI transitions that moved perpendicularly to the direction of touch gestures on the touchpad of Glass, instead of in parallel on a smartphone, felt peculiar as well. </p>

<h4 id="okglasssendamessage">“OK, Glass. Send a message.”</h4>

<p>In terms of email, I could quickly check and send messages on Glass through voice-enabled commands. However, accessing menu items to reply or forward emails using a touchpad located on the side of my hand felt cumbersome and unintuitive. Functionality associated with replying to an email and forwarding an email to another person could have been integrated with voice commands and make using email on Glass an even more efficient process than it is now. In future iterations, I think Glass will greatly benefit from a completely voice-activated email system, making a once-dreaded task simple and easy to do on-the-go for working professionals.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a user, the ability to operate a camera hands-free is probably one of Glass’ most convenient functions. Not only does the picture quality on Glass rivals that of a smartphone, but being able to document one’s life from a first-person perspective and easily share the picture or recording with loved ones on Glass really captures Google’s mission in designing the wearable technology to complement the user’s life experience and to help the user closely connect with friends and family. Now to think of it, what is a better way to share a good experience than from the eye of the person who experienced it?</p>

<p>Lastly, I found the experience of asking Glass to Google a query and having the exact result displayed in front of my views to be quite powerful and exhilarating, even if at times the natural language search was a tad off in capturing the exact query. This feature is very useful because the information that I received did not obstruct my vision as I carried out my daily routine. The wearable’s voice-enabled search clearly illustrates the benefit of augmented reality when information is needed at a moment’s notice.</p>

<h4 id="okglasstakeanote">“OK, Glass. Take a note.”</h4>

<p>At first, it felt frustrating and cumbersome to navigate through the timeline with the touchpad and interact with Glassware through voice commands. Having been accustomed to interacting with computing devices through touch, I realized that Glass presents a new frontier of human-computer interaction that Google dares to explore.</p>

<p>In its prototype stage, Glass feels more or less like an advanced version of a smartphone. The device’s mixture of voice and touch human-computer interaction demonstrates its hands-free potential, but more work is needed in refining the natural language processing and minimalizing tactile methods of interaction in order for Glass to bring true hands-free value to the user.</p>

<p>Unless the user knows exactly what he or she wants to explore with Glass (and understands the social implications of being a ‘Glasshole’), the $1500 will not bring much added value to most smartphone-accustomed people. Yet, the current prototype barely scratches the tip of the iceberg that represents the wearable’s potential, leaving much room for UI/UX innovation to encompass a wide variety of user needs and applications.</p>

<p>In terms of pushing for the mainstream adoption of Glass, Google’s biggest challenge is in convincing people to wear the device. Glass the technology possesses great potential in changing the lives of its users for the better. However, Google needs to clearly market this potential through a much more appealing design of Glass that expertly conveys the company’s sense and understanding of user empathy.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/04/o-k-glass-google-how-are-you-going-to-get-people-to-wear-you/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">95487b7b-8aff-4703-b5c1-2a68c780d782</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 02:10:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA["OK, Glass. Show me more!"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h4 id="okglassgooglehowcanigetstartedwithyourplatform">“OK, Glass. Google how can I get started with your platform?”</h4>

<p><a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/overview' >The Glass platform</a> enables developers to write Android code that runs directly on Glass or RESTful web services that effectively leverage the company’s scale and infrastructure. In addition, Google has proposed design patterns that help developers determine how to best utilize the two API options when developing Glassware. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/index' >The Glass Development Kit</a> (GDK) is an add-on to the Android SDK that lets developers build Glassware that directly runs on glass.  In general, the GDK is useful for real-time user interaction, offline functionality, and access to low-level hardware features. <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/24/glass-just-got-way-more-interesting/' >The GDK enables developers to experiment with the full potential of Glass</a>. This means that it will not only make augmented reality apps on Glass a reality, but also give any mobile app with advanced graphics the ability to run on Glass. </p></li>
<li><p><a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/mirror/index' >The Mirror API</a> enables developers to build Glassware in the language of their choice and provides an easy way to call web-based APIs to build web-based services but does not require running code on Glass.  In general, the Mirror API is used for platform independence, common infrastructure, and built-in functionality. It enables developers to push and pull information asynchronously and then to display on Glass through its card-like interface. This is great for <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/25/google-opens-glass-mirror-api-to-all-developers-even-if-they-dont-have-glass/' >creating Glassware like news apps and social networking services</a> that can use Glass to display statuses and updates in the primary timeline interface. </p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible to develop Glassware with a hybrid model that enables Mirror API Glassware to invoke GDK Glassware through a menu item to launch fuller user experiences that run directly on Glass.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowdoesthemirrorapiwork">OK, Glass. Google how does the Mirror API work?”</h4>

<p>The Mirror API provides developers with client libraries to Glassware similar to web-based CRUD applications in the Go, Java, Microsoft .Net, PHP, Python and Ruby programming languages. Although the Mirror API does provide platform independence for developers, it more or less makes Glass an extension of existing social and news services – a glorified smartwatch that delivers notifications and updates right in front of your eyes.  </p>

<p>The Mirror API takes advantage of <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/mirror/static-cards' >static cards</a> that display information relevant to the user at the time of delivery, such as periodic notifications. Through simple REST APIs, static cards can also start live cards or immersions for a more interactive experience.  However, because it was not designed to receive requests from users that require instantaneous response, <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/distribute/best-practices' >it does not provide a good user experience for functionalities like voice-controlled search</a>.  </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/insert-static-card.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>To insert static cards to the user’s timeline interface in Glass, simply POST a JSON representation of a timeline item, perhaps with a media attachment, to the REST endpoint.</p>

<p>In raw HTTP:  </p>

<pre><code>POST /mirror/v1/timeline HTTP/1.1  
Host: www.googleapis.com 
Authorization: Bearer {auth token}
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 26
{ "text": "Hello world" }
</code></pre>

<p>In Python:  </p>

<p><pre><code>timeline<em>item = {'text': 'Hello world'}
service.timeline().insert(body=timeline</em>item).execute()</pre></code></p>

<p>With the inserted item appearing in the user’s Glass timeline like this: </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/hello-world-card.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>The Mirror API also allows the developer to subscribe to notifications that are sent when the user takes specific actions on a Timeline Item or by taking advantage of the Glass’ geo-tracking features, when the user location has been updated.</p>

<p>For a subscribed endpoint to receive notifications, a notification from the Mirror API is sent as a POST request to the endpoint containing a JSON request body.</p>

<p>In raw HTTP:  </p>

<p><pre><code>{
  "collection": "timeline",
  "itemId": "3hidvm0xez6r8dacdb3103b8b604h8rpllg",
  "operation": "UPDATE",
  "userToken": "harold-penguin",
  "verifyToken": "random-hash-to-verify-referer",
  "userActions": [
    {
      "type": "<TYPE>",
      "payload": "<PAYLOAD>"
    }
  ]
}</pre></code></p>

<p>Overall, the Mirror API provides little opportunities for Glassware innovation because it allows developers to only make changes to the primary timeline experience and receive notifications of user interaction with the timeline’s static cards. In other words, the Mirror API only serves to bring the functionality of a smartphone (annoyingly) close to the user.</p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowdoesthegdkunlockyourpotential">“OK, Glass. Google how does the GDK unlock your potential?”</h4>

<p>For many developers, <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/29/the-upcoming-glass-development-kit-launch-will-finally-allow-google-glass-to-live-up-to-its-potential/' >the Mirror API was a disappointment</a> because it limited innovation on Glass, making the device nothing more than a fancy apparatus for Google Now. Before the release of the GDK, all developers could do was push notifications and receive media from the wearable device.  </p>

<p>By enabling developers to use the GDK in combination with the Android SDK, they will not only be able to leverage the vast array of Android APIs already available, but also design a fully immersive user experience for Glass that transcends its primary timeline interface. For example, with the GDK, developers can render complex OpenGL-based graphics on Glass instead of only the HTML-based cards that the Mirror API allows, enabling them to build real-time augmented-reality apps, games, and perhaps even those controversial real-time facial recognition apps.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/android-gdk.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>GDK’s <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/live-cards' >live cards</a> feature enhances user interaction with Glass when the user is actively engaged in a task and can provide supplemental information that is relevant at the current time to the user. Live cards are very suited for real-time needs, such as real-time interaction with users and real-time updates to the user interface. They persist in the present section of the timeline for as long as they are relevant, and users can explicitly remove them after the information is no longer needed. However, users are not solely constrained to the experience of the live card and can freely move about the timeline as they desire. Live cards can be rendered with low frequency, for simple content, or with high frequency, for advanced graphics.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/using-live-cards.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>In addition to live cards, <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/immersions' >immersions</a> enable developers to create extremely customized user experiences because they are displayed outside of the timeline and give the user complete control of the Glass experience when the immersion is launched. They give the best Glassware experiences that require prolonged user attention, providing opportunities for the creation of specialized UI to suit very specific user needs. Immersions are built with standard Android tools, while the GDK is used to integrate voice commands and Glass-styled cards to the immersion to create a novel Glass experience. </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/immersion-1.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>The GDK also provides a <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/immersions' >gesture detector</a> for developers to incorporate common Glass gestures, such as tapping, swiping, and scrolling, into the user experience when designing Glassware. In addition, <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/location-sensors' >location and sensor data</a> can be accessed using the standard Android platform APIs, new Glassware can utilize the <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/camera' >camera</a> for a variety of different use cases, and <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/starting-glassware' >unique voice commands</a> can be created for any individual Glassware.  </p>

<p>One of the <a href='http://savvyapps.com/blog/initial-impressions-glass-development-kit-gdk/' >most appealing qualities</a> of the <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/index' >GDK</a> is how Google pairs Glass to its more-developed Android platform. By doing so, Google enables hackers to spend less time ramping up to a new development environment and <a href='http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/19/google-glass-development-kit/' >more time designing complex and innovative user interfaces and exploring novel user applications for Glassware</a>.  This is a great pitch for the Android community. It also ensures that once Glass is available to the average consumer, <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/19/google-releases-glass-development-kit-sneak-peek-and-5-new-glass-apps-that-already-use-it/' >the digital marketplace will be flush with apps</a> ready for immediate download and use. </p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglewhataresomeofyourrealworldapplications">“OK, Glass. Google what are some of your real world applications?”</h4>

<p>Google Glass represents the merger of the physical and digital worlds, providing numerous opportunities for innovative uses of the wearable technology. With the release of the GDK in late 2013, developers now have the potential to create user experiences for Glass that complement those in real life. Although most apps have simply utilized the platform to transplant smartphone functions closer to the user’s senses, startups are currently experimenting with the possibilities that Glass provides for augmented reality.</p>

<p>One revenue-generating application of Glassware is for e-commerce. The Fancy, a startup based in New York City for high fashion and luxury goods, takes advantage of “the spontaneity of being able to discover and buy things you’ll love based on <a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/11/5091086/meet-the-first-and-only-company-making-money-through-its-google-glass' >what’s right in front of your eyes</a>.”  With the belief that Glass should be used to create experiences to enhance real life, The Fancy incorporates what people see in their daily surroundings to drive their purchase of what they find value in the world. </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/the-fancy.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from e-commerce, the medical community has seen the potential for Google Glass to become an integrative part of healthcare. Surgeons have noted the potential for Glass as a “surgical and teaching tool is tremendous,” and that new applications will “<a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnosta/2013/06/21/google-glass-in-the-operating-room/' >help transform surgery and the surgical experience</a>.”  For example, Glass’ camera enables medical students and colleagues <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130815203138-19886490-google-glas-in-or?trk=mp-author-card' >to view operations literally through the eyes of the surgeon</a> performing the operation, instead of having to watch from fixed camera points or over the surgeon’s shoulder. This capability that Glass provides for doctors will ensure better surgical outcomes in the operating room, as more people are able to participate in the surgery and support the surgeon performing the operation.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based Augmedix has <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/augmedix-raises-3-2m-to-make-google-glass-standard-kit-for-future-doctors/' >recently raised $3.2M</a> to incorporate Google Glass into clinical care by pushing electronic health records directly to a doctor’s headset.  Today, doctors spend between 30-50 percent of their day documenting the electronic health record, and they often do it in front of patients during appointments. According to the CEO of Augmedix, Glass will <a href='http://mobihealthnews.com/31314/augmedix-gets-3-2-million-to-bring-google-glass-to-doctors/' >yield better outcomes for clinical documentation quality</a> and improve clinical outcomes in the long run by re-humanizing patient-doctor interaction at the point of care. </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/augmedix.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>However, despite the possibilities that Google Glass offers for medicine, <a href='http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2013/09/google-glass-medicine-4-reasons-disastrous.html' >some are still doubtful of the wearable technology’s reliability</a>, particularly in respect to privacy and security of sensitive health information. If developers can create Glassware that can be <a href='http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/08/12/google-glass-could-become-a-fixture-in-the-operating-room/' >clinically shown to improve health outcomes</a>, as well as <a href='http://rgrosssz.com/2013/06/20/ok-glass-pass-me-the-scalpel-please-googleglass-during-surgery/' >ensure the privacy of the patient’s health information</a>, then Glass may find a permanent home in the doctor’s technology toolkit. </p>

<p>Google Glass provides opportunities for countless user experience innovations and paves the way for the integration of augmented reality into the daily life of consumers. The device’s human-centric design, Android-based development platform, and potential Glassware applications across a diverse set of industries makes its mainstream consumer adoption a matter of not “if”, but “when.”</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/04/o-k-glass-show-me-more/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">31be84de-966e-4782-8a7f-5c6c2d9fc5c8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 01:55:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA["OK, Glass. Show me what you can do!"]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Despite consumer concerns regarding its privacy-intrusion capabilities and impact on societal norms, Google Glass is a very intriguing and curious device, one that may still be too advanced for our time. Yet, the Glass platform offers many avenues for user-centric innovation, bringing augmented reality closer to reality than ever before.</p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowareyoudesignedtobeusercentric">“OK, Glass. Google how are you designed to be user-centric?”</h4>

<p>Both the software and hardware of Google Glass was designed to be human-centric: to not take the user away from life, but rather to supplement it. In its design principles, Google claims that, “<a href='https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers' >Glass is fundamentally different than existing mobile platforms in both design and use</a>.”  </p>

<p>Because users tend to have multiple devices that stores and displays information for periods of time, Glass works best with information that is simple and time-relevant to increase user engagement and satisfaction. Google Glass sits above a user’s natural line of sight, allowing people to both experience the world and access the device for information relevant to their immediate environment.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/jellyfish.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Unlike other wearable technologies, Glass was created to be the most intimate of its kind. Therefore, unexpected functionality and disruptions in Glassware amplify the severity of the bad experience on Glass than on any other computing device. </p>

<p>Because Glass was designed to be close to the user’s senses, it meant to be there for the user when he or she needs to interact with the device and gets out of the way when it is not needed. For example, such an experience would involve Glass delivering a shopping list when the user arrives at a grocery store. </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/grocery.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Because Glass was designed to enhance the daily life of its user, Google asserts that Glassware interface should be designed in line with natural human behavior - that is, to utilize “imagery, colloquial voice interactions, and natural gestures.” The ideal Glassware implements a “fire-and-forget model” that minimalizes unnecessary distractions, allowing the user to quickly start actions in Glass and then return to what they were doing prior to receiving a Glassware notification.</p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowdoidesignglassware">“OK, Glass. Google how do I design Glassware?”</h4>

<p>Google provides <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/design/patterns' >common UX patterns</a> to give users a consistent experience across all Glassware. Thee basic UI elements, when paired with invocation methods, can be used in combination to build a wide variety of usage cases. </p>

<ul>
<li>Static card display text, HTML, images, and videos that can invoke live cards or immersions.
<img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/static-card.png'  alt="" /></li>
<li>Live cards are rendered at a high frequency to display cards that are important at the current movement.
<img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/live-card.png'  alt="" /></li>
<li>Immersions display unique Android activities that take place outside of the timeline experience.
<img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/immersion.png'  alt="" /></li>
</ul>

<p>Google wanted voice commands to be an integral Glass experience, as it is intended to provide the user with the ability to do things hands-free, quickly, and naturally. Invocation methods include the universal “O.K., Glass” command that is used to activate the touch or voice menu. </p>

<p>Ironically enough, Google set up strict guidelines to make voice commands sound socially comfortable, highlighting that they should be colloquial and easy to say when used. In addition, the company places heavy emphasis on the human-centric quality of voice command design, asserting that they “should be based on what users want to do and not what Glassware is carrying out the action.” Good voice commands carry out actions as quickly as possible and should be general enough to apply to multiple Glassware.</p>

<p>Because <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/design/style' >Google seeks to maintain the style of Glass’ unique design paradigm</a>, the company provides a standard card template, color pallete, typography, and writing guidelines, and encourages developers of Glassware to follow them as closely as possible.  For example, the company heavily documents the layout and margin guidelines for different types of timeline cards for the Glass user interface. By doing so, Google champions for a fluid and consistent user experience across all Glassware applications.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/glass-dimensions.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>It also provides patterns for user-Glass interactions, such as periodic notifications based on settings that the user defines, ongoing tasks on long-running live cards that users leave and come back to frequently, and immersions in the form of Android activities that momentarily take over the standard timeline experience. For example, the Stopwatch app that is shipped with the Glass Developer Kit starts the stopwatch with the iconic “O.K., Glass” command. By integrating recognizable visual cues with natural-sounding vocal commands while minimizing tactile control of Glass, Google has effectively demonstrated its sole focus on the user in showcasing the beginnings of its novel Google-level design for the future of wearable technology.</p>

Google why are people so concerned about you?”]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Since the launch of the Google Glass Explorer Program, ‘Glassholes’, the derogatory name dubbed for early adopters of the wearable technology, have obtained minor celebrity status. Curious people approach them with questions about the still-rare technology, even asking to try Glass out and getting their pictures taken. <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/10/tech/mobile/negative-google-glass-reactions/' >Others are quite confrontational</a>, angry that ‘Glassholes’ even dare to wear recording devices on their faces in public and potentially invade the privacy of those around them.  Negative reactions to Google Glass make headlines often, and the technology has been banned, even prior to its initial 2013 release, in many bars and restaurants for the device’s potential privacy-violating capabilities. </p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/no-glassholes-allowed.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowareyousodifferentfromasmartphone">“OK, Glass. Google how are you so different from a smartphone?”</h4>

<p>Smartphones and Glass share many technological features, such as having cameras to record videos and audio and take photographs and being able to instantly upload information to social media sites. Yet, the wearable device has elicited very different reactions than the ones its smartphone counterparts faced in the past. Because there are very few Google Glass units used by consumers, people do not really grasp the limitations of the device. Anti-glass sentiments arise because unlike smartphones, the wearable is a piece of technology that stands outside of an individual’s sphere of control or influence. With smartphones, users have a choice to stay connected with technology, but with Glass, the ability to make that choice can be taken away from them by someone else’s decision.</p>

<p>Critics have especially raised concerns regarding Glass’ capabilities for the intrusion of privacy. With smartphones, the user would need to physically hold up the phone’s camera and point it at the subject, thus providing a visual cue of whether the user is recording the subject. However, with Glass, because there is no external indicator light that shows when Glass is in recording mode, people see Glass as a heavy intrusion of their privacy, fearful of being recorded in public without their knowledge or consent by Glass wearers.</p>

<p>The privacy fear is not only rooted in in the act of a Glass wearer recording another without informed consent, but also that the recording can be uploaded to Google’s servers, potentially stored for the rest of a person’s lifetime and <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/06/google-glass-threat-to-our-privacy' >be made available to access by anyone</a>. With Google Glass, the fear associated with being recorded in public without permission is greatly magnified because the nascent device evokes an uncomfortable feeling of a <a href='http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/controversy-grows-over-googles-glass-project/article4553860.ece' >constant, invasive surveillance</a> through a ubiquitous computing network controlled by Google. </p>

<h4 id="okglassgoogleareyougoingtoturnpeopleintocyborgs">“OK, Glass. Google are you going to turn people into cyborgs?”</h4>

<p>In addition, critics question the etiquette and ethics of using Glass in public. A London-based campaign group, ‘<a href='http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-glass-will-make-privacy-impossible-warn-stop-the-cyborgs-campaigners-8550499.html' >Stop the Cyborgs</a>’ are calling for limits in which the technology is used and that guidelines should be in place to inform the public when they are being filmed. The privacy advocacy group does not seek to ban the wearable device altogether, but “encourage individual people to think about the impact of new technologies, to set bounds on how new technologies are used (and) proactively negotiate their relationship with the future.” As Google’s Eric Schmidt puts it, with the emergence of Google Glass for consumer use, <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10015697/Google-Glass-well-all-need-etiquette-lessons.html' >new social etiquette</a> will need to be developed to justify the appropriate use of this novel wearable and to ensure people’s privacy. </p>

<h4 id="okglassgooglehowhardistoforyoutogethacked">“OK, Glass. Google how hard is to for you to get hacked?”</h4>

<p>Glass’ lack of a PIN or authentication system is possibly one of the most direct threats to the owner’s privacy. However, <a href='http://www.slashgear.com/glass-privacy-concern-dismissal-doesnt-pacify-us-congress-committee-02288698/' >in response to a US congressional committee concerned with this issue</a>, Google has confirmed that it is currently working on <a href='http://www.slashgear.com/glass-boutique-app-store-mp3-player-lock-screen-more-revealed-05289182/' >a lock system</a> for Glass to protect private information stored on the device.</p>

<p>In its prototype stage, Glass can also be easily hacked. A Santa Barbara-based programmer discovered that Glass has <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/01/google-glass-security-privacy-risk' >a ‘root’ capability</a> that can be enabled by attaching it to a desktop computer and activating some commands.  That means, if an attacker gains access to another’s Glass, they will be able to monitor the wearer’s every move, take pictures of the wearer’s surrounding, and potentially gain access to the wearer’s private information. Because of the way that Glass is designed, the wearable is susceptible to many of the security issues that plague Android devices. </p>

<p>Another technical feature of Glass that might greatly threaten consumer privacy is the implementation of a facial recognition system. Despite Google’s attempts to <a href='https://developers.google.com/glass/policies' >prohibit the installation of such technology onto Glass unit</a>, hackers have already circumvented this policy by building <a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/17/202725167/clever-hacks-give-google-glass-many-unintended-powers?v=Szc6FydhxJE' >non-Google approved operating systems</a>. To continue pushing for the mainstream adoption of Glass, Google needs to take initiative to set a standard of strong privacy standards and practices for wearable technology that parallels its existing Internet services.  Although Google claims that it has built Glass to put users in control to protect their privacy, the fact that the search company <a href='http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/' >reserves its right to changes its policies at any time and without notice</a> makes full, informed consent impractical. </p>

<p>Google has taken measures to address the privacy controversy surrounding Glass, asserting that its Glass Explorer program will enable early participants to shape “the future of this technology, including its features and social norms.” The search company’s greatest challenge in promoting the widespread adoption for Glass is to balance opportunities for the technology and those who are keen to explore it with those who are concerned with the technology’s capability to intrude the privacy of the wearer and those the wearer may come into contact with. For what may be the most high-profile product entry into the tech market, Google has drawn up <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/glasscomms/glass-explorers' >a list of Do’s and Don’ts</a> for current and potential Glass explorers to ease up public fears about privacy and social tensions that the device may cause to others in preparation for the device’s mass-market release in the upcoming years.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/04/o-k-glass-google-why-are-people-so-concerned-about-you/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">25a3d601-cf56-479d-96a4-9075a878723a</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 04:34:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA["OK, Glass.

With the PageRank algorithm, Google took advantage of the interconnected nature of the World Wide Web to <a href='http://www.amazon.com/In-The-Plex-Google-Thinks/dp/1455875724' >create a search engine</a> that would provide even the most obscure knowledge within seconds to people at the touch of their fingertip.</p>

<p>That was over 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Today, Google is a multinational corporation that stretches across many Internet verticals, including search, online advertising, software, and cloud computing. Backed by a well-established technological infrastructure and an extraordinary pool of technical talent, <a href='http://www.crunchbase.com/product/google-glass' >Google</a> now seeks to take another huge leap for mankind: freeing data from computers and mobile devices and placing the world’s information directly in front of the eyes of the viewer. </p>

<p>Welcome Project Glass, a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display that augments its user’s reality through delivery of real-time data.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/google-glass.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>At Google I/O 2012, Google Glass (literally) <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE' >skydived</a> into San Francisco’s Moscone Center and was greeted amidst a sea of thundering applause. By teaming with some of world’s top athletes in skydiving and mountain biking, Google took the product demo of Google Glass to the next level. In the process of doing so, Google also shared an extraordinary, first-hand experience of the possibilities that hands-free, ubiquitous computing can bring to the world.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/May/glass-skydiving.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Powered by <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/larry-page-says-google-glass-runs-on-android/' >Android</a>, Project Glass spurred both excitement and controversy when Google <a href='http://www.wired.com/2012/04/epicenter-google-glass-ar/' >first revealed its concept in April 2012</a>. On the one hand, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb2uojqKvFM' >the possibilities that Glass offered to its user seemed endless</a>: monitoring feeds about the weather, creating instant contact with friends, receiving turn-by-turn to your desired destination, just to name a few.  On the other hand, Glass sparked consumer worries regarding <a href='http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/09/16/do-google-glasses-present-serious-privacy-problem-overreacting/' >privacy concerns</a> and the questionable security of personal information. </p>

<p>Born in Google X, the same lab that incubated the development of futuristic technology such as driverless cars and space elevators, the wearable device was nowhere complete for consumer sales, let alone for public beta, during <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/technology/google-glasses-will-be-powered-by-android.html?_r=2' >its initial release</a>. Yet in 2012, the search company <a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/google-begins-testing-its-augmented-reality-glasses/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0' >made a crucial move</a> in unveiling its Project Glass efforts in order to <a href='http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/google-begins-testing-its-augmented-reality-glasses/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0' >ignite conversation with future users</a>. </p>

<p>In April 2013, <a href='http://www.cnet.com/news/brin-google-glass-lands-for-consumers-in-2014/' >the Google Glass explorer edition was made available for pilot testers and developers</a> in the United States at $1,500. A year later on <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/15/if-you-want-google-glass-nows-your-chance/' >April 15, 2014</a>, a more “<a href='http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4017634/google-glass-for-consumers-planned-to-ship-in-2013-and-cost-less-than-1500' >fully-polished</a>” version of the headset was released for consumers at the same price for only one day. In addition, the tech ecosystem for Google Glass, backed by the early adopter Explorer program, appears to thrive, with nine software updates released, 42 Glassware apps developed, iOS support integrated, prescription frames added, and more to date.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/10/tech/innovation/google-glass-april-15/' >During its first year of release</a>, Google Glass has been lauded tremendously as the future of wearable computing, criticized heavily for leading the apocalypse of consumer privacy, and mocked shamelessly for its lack of style and uber-nerd appeal. Because of the ethical and safety problems Glass poses, its users have banned from bars and restaurants, <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/tech/innovation/google-glass-ticket-dismissed/' >ticketed for distracted driving</a>, and <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/19/tech/mobile/google-glasshole/' >dubbed infamously as ‘Glassholes.’</a></p>

<p>So what is the verdict for Glass? Is it indeed the future of wearable technology? Or will it forever remain the punch line of geeky jokes? </p>

<p>In this three-fold project, I will </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Explore the societal and legal ramifications of Google Glass in respect to ethics and policy</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the technical foundations of Google Glass from a design and development perspective, as well as current Glassware applications</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a human-centric perspective of a reality augmented with Glass technology</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By doing so, I hope to provide a multifaceted response to the following question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is it going to take for Google to obtain the mainstream adoption of Glass?</p>

<h4 id="ohbitcoin">Oh, Bitcoin.</h4>

<p>"Beware the mania for Bitcoin, the tulip of the 21st century," states <a href='http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8cd97efe-7c6f-11e3-b514-00144feabdc0.html' #axzz2xDKvtQ00">Jean-Pierre Landau</a>.</p>

<p>“Bitcoin is evil," decries <a href='http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/Bitcoin-is-evil/' >Paul Krugman</a>.</p>

<p>Financial experts are quick to point out that the recent popularity and excitement surrounding Bitcoin does not necessarily translate into its economic reality.</p>

<p>Yet, Bitcoin disrupts the conventional way people think about and use money. It is not paper-based, but rather Internet-based. Bitcoin, at its core, is a breakthrough in computer science. It provides an unequivocal and secure method for one Internet user to transfer a piece of unique digital property to another Internet user. </p>

<p>The real disruptive power of Bitcoin to our economy and society does not lie in its intrinsic value as a currency, but rather in its underlying platform, the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is the currency of the future because its technological basis enables it to transform one of the fundamental things that people do - make payments.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinsdecentralizedpeertopeersystemdisruptshowfinancialinstitutionsprocesspayment">Bitcoin’s decentralized, peer-to-peer system disrupts how financial institutions process payment.</h4>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument that provides a secure, decentralized way to record and transfer ownership rights of money and assets between unrelated parties, without the presence of a trusted intermediary. The Bitcoin protocol is a <a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/02/15/bitcoin-platform-currency/1/' >Big Bang Disruption</a> that runs the world’s first truly open financial network. </p>

<p>The <a href='https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spendinghttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending' >double-spending problem</a> used to plague creators of digital cash: how do you prevent a person from using the same digital coin twice. Before Bitcoin, the only solution was to have a central authority to approve a transaction as final. However, <a href='http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf' >Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, through Bitcoin, was the first to create an electronic system to solve the double-spending problem in a completely, decentralized fashion.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin block chain serves as a decentralized, shared public ledger that, as a whole, keeps track of Bitcoin addresses. Through a safe, transparent, and mathematically secure method, ownership rights to digital money flow directly from the sender’s digital wallet to the receiver’s digital wallet. Bitcoin offers a peer-to-peer system that removes people’s need for a central authority to process monetary transactions when making payments.</p>

<p>Whereas financial institutions heavily safeguard their private ledgers, anyone can validate transactions and ownership of all Bitcoins anytime they want. This ensures not only the security, but also the transparency of financial assets stored in the Bitcoin network. Anyone can buy into the distributed ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots (aka the digital “coins”); owners of these slots can sell out of the ledger anytime, anywhere by trading their Bitcoin to someone else that wants to buy into the ledger. Bitcoin’s public ledger makes transaction fees much, much lower than those of a central bank, and eliminates authorization imposed by a central authority; Bitcoin users can directly buy in or out of the ledger at little to no cost when making payments.</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network disrupts the traditional operation of financial institutions. First, there is the impossibility of financial censorship by a single party because the Bitcoin ledger is public. Therefore, all payment transactions are logged and openly displayed.  Second, since transactions must be confirmed at least six times by computers across a distributed network, there is no single point of failure. Therefore, payment fraud can be easily detected. Third, unlike a private ledger kept by banks, Bitcoin transactions are completely transparent, allowing for financial openness and promoting trust for Bitcoin as an accepted payment system.</p>

<p>Marc Andreessen asserts that Bitcoin’s future lies in <a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1' >a classic network effect</a>, a positive feedback loop driven by the self-interested participation of four distinct groups: (1) consumers (2) merchants (3) miners and (4) developers and entrepreneurs. Bitcoin miners run the computers that process and validate the transactions that take place across the cryptocurrency’s decentralized network. Anyone with the technical know-how can download the Bitcoin open-source mining software and build their own mining rig. In addition, as their reward, miners can earn 25 bitcoins for solving ever-increasing computational problems that process Bitcoin transactions. The ease of participation on the Bitcoin platform, along with the incentive to process Bitcoin transactions, supports the decentralized network that enables Bitcoin to not only pose a threat to financial institutions, but to also gain popularity as a form of accepted currency and payment system.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinasatechnologicalplatformdrivesfinancialinnovationforpaymentsystems">Bitcoin as a technological platform drives financial innovation for payment systems.</h4>

<p>The more people that use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin becomes for everyone to use it, providing a higher incentive for the next person to start using the technology. Bitcoin as an evolving technological platform not only makes the digital currency easier for newcomers to use, but transforms money into "<a href='http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/02/15/bitcoin-platform-currency/1/' >smart money</a>". It enables developers and entrepreneurs, a group that is part of Andreessen’s four-sided network effect, to create consumer products and services on top of the Bitcoin platform that have been, until recently, impossible. With more products and services that utilize Bitcoin, the more prevalent Bitcoin becomes as an adopted payment system.</p>

<p><a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/bitcoin-is-a-money-platform-with-many-apis.html' >Bitcoin makes money programmable</a>, hence why it is so popular among developers. it is an application programming interface (API) for money that provides the opportunity for developers to create countless financial innovations. Bitcoin not only offers an API for personal accounts and transactions, but makes that API available to coders. As a predominantly, developer-driven technology, Bitcoin gives its users the power to define the usage and control of money, leading to a faster rate of product innovation of Bitcoin as a payment system with broader consumer appeal.</p>

<p>Traditional money do have APIs, but <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/bitcoin-is-a-money-platform-with-many-apis.html' >they are closed to regular people</a>. In a traditional financial network, trust between parties is achieved through a complex web of regulations, fraud detection, and accreditation. Financial networks are protected through exclusivity: APIs are closed and inaccessible except to the few that are trusted. For example, Mastercard and Paypal limit who can build applications on top of their platforms and what those applications can do. However, trust in the Bitcoin financial model is distributed across a large and ever-growing network of collaborators who continuously validate each other’s activity. As a result, there is no need for access controls or exclusivity to maintain Bitcoin as a secure way for payment. Everyone can participate in the Bitcoin network and access the APIs.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested in just under 50 million dollars in Bitcoin-related startups and actively searches for more Bitcoin-related investment opportunities. The firm believes that the network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance as a widespread payment system in the not-so-distant future. One of the most exciting applications include building <a href='http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/17/bitcoin-for-idiots-an-introductory-guide/' >a Bitcoin platform for international remittance</a>. Because Bitcoin transaction fees are much lower than the amount that banks and payments companies extract from international transactions, switching to Bitcoin will enable immigrants to keep more of the money that they send to their families in their home countries. In addition, Bitcoin presents <a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1' >further opportunities in micropayments</a>, and can be a catalyst that drives the development of modern economic systems in third world countries. These are the types of possibilities that make Bitcoin evangelists so excited about the cryptocurrency and its potential for innovation and widespread adoption as a payment system.</p>

<h4 id="bitcointhetechnologypromotesadoptionofbitcointhecurrencyasamethodofpayment">Bitcoin the technology promotes adoption of Bitcoin the currency as a method of payment.</h4>

<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency whose value is based on (1) the use of the payment system today and (2) future speculation of the use of the payment system. It is not that the Bitcoin currency has an arbitrary value and people are trading it. Rather, it is because Bitcoin is used for trading that as a result, the cryptocurrency has value. Although the current value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than its actual payment volume, Bitcoin’s value has increased dramatically during recent months because <a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1' >speculation have made more people aware of the reality of its usefulness for payments</a>.</p>

<p>Edward Hadas, Reuters’ economics editor, calls Bitcoin “<a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/Bitcoin-a-fools-gold-standard/' >a Fool’s Gold Standard</a>.” Critics of Bitcoin point out that even though Bitcoin operates like mainstream currencies, it will never attain the real value associated with conventional money because it is not backed by a central bank. They argue that Bitcoin’s volatility not only makes the predictability of its value impossible, but can render them almost worthless. Yet every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using, and selling Bitcoins all around the world. As Bitcoin tools and technology are improved by developers and entrepreneurs, the cryptocurrency becomes easier, and more secure for everyone to use. And as more and more people use Bitcoin, the value of the digital currency will also expand and drive its adoption as a popular payment system among mainstream users.</p>

<p>Critics of Bitcoin also highlight that given the small number of consumers who currently pay with the digital currency, <a href='http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2014/01/24/why-bitcoin-could-fail/' >its volatility makes it unappealing to merchants</a>. Yet why would merchants not be interested in a digital alternative for businesses <a href='http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/why-Bitcoin-matters/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1' >when conventional payment fees consume nearly half of profit margins</a> and conventional payment methods make accepting international payments difficult? </p>

<p>In addition, merchants are attracted to Bitcoin because <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/30/credit-card-security-is-broken-heres-how-bitcoin-could-help-fix-it/' >its technological protocol eliminates the risk of credit card fraud</a>. The receiver of a payment through Bitcoin does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future. The digital currency’s technological basis in cryptography protects the private information of receivers and senders, while its distributed ledger ensures the validity of all payment transactions taking place in the network. Bitcoin is different from conventional methods of electronic payment because <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/30/credit-card-security-is-broken-heres-how-bitcoin-could-help-fix-it/' >it puts the liability of the payment on the payer</a>. Because merchants know that payments via Bitcoin are coming directly from the buyer and that payments via Bitcoin from the buyer are irreversible, merchants can increase their profit margins by accepting Bitcoin for payment.</p>

<p>One thing that both critics and developers agree on is that Bitcoin’s number one issue is security. On February 7, 2014, Mt.Gox, the Japan-based exchange that once held 80% of the world’s Bitcoin trades, halted withdrawals of the digital currency due to transaction malleability, an attack that changes the unique ID of a Bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the Bitcoin network. Critics were quick to highlight the shutdown of Mt.Gox and the subsequent drop in Bitcoin prices as a sign of the ‘<a href='http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bug-guide-transaction-malleability/' >cryptocalypse</a>’, the end of the Bitcoin world as we know it. Yet despite the media hype of Mt. Gox, it is easy to forget that <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/bitcoin-is-the-new-paypal/?ncid=fb' >Bitcoin is a nascent technology</a> and that fraud can occur on multiple fronts to other Bitcoin services as well. Developers are aware that Bitcoin presents some of the most interesting and challenging computer science problems to solve right now, and that <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/05/bitcoins-future-foretold-by-developer-momentum/' >multifaceted solutions are required to prevent future fraud</a>.</p>

<p>From a technological standpoint, Bitcoin’s transaction malleability problems are no more than fixable software bugs, common to all emerging software technologies. Although a major Bitcoin exchange has been shut down, transaction malleability does not break the core of Bitcoin operation. Its decentralized network forms the crux of the digital currency’s appeal to not only developers, miners, and entrepreneurs, but also to consumers who pay with Bitcoin and merchants who accept Bitcoin.</p>

<h4 id="bitcoinisforthepeople">Bitcoin is for the people.</h4>

<p>In truth, only time can tell Bitcoin’s viability as a long-term currency. However, its future as the go-to payment system of tomorrow is brighter than ever before. Because it operates as a distributed, peer-to-peer system that promotes financial transparency, Bitcoin eliminates the need for financial institutions as a third party to confirm payment transactions. Its basis as an evolving technology platform provide countless opportunities for developer and entrepreneurs to redefine conventional methods of payment. Lastly, Bitcoin the technology drives adoption of Bitcoin the currency as an accepted form of payment among merchants and consumers because it is circulated directly between buyers and sellers, and requires no authorization and little to no transaction fees.</p>

<p>In an allusion to the famous quote from Abe Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Bitcoin, especially  the technology as a form of payment, is “of the people”, “by the people”, and “for the people.” Who knows if it will ultimately “perish from the earth”? But from where it stands today, Bitcoin has no chance of doing so anytime in the near future. And if you need proof that Bitcoin is what Gavin Andresen, chief-scientist of Bitcoin Foundation, calls the “<a href='http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html' >decentralized currency of the people</a>”, have you heard of <a href='http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fan-holding-sign-espn-racks-25000-bitcoin-donations/' >the Auburn fan who racked up over $24,000 in Bitcoin through ESPN</a>?</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/03/the-future-of-payments-is-bitcoin/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">029d47bc-3e55-46ba-94a8-c727e7331504</guid><category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2014 22:08:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Tech Giants of China: Xiaomi, Alibaba, and Sina Weibo]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/china.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="chinagoestechsaavy">China goes tech-saavy.</h4>

<p>In the 1970s, and especially during the 1990s, <a href='http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/924' >foreign direct investments have improved the quality of the Chinese high technology industry</a>. In 2001, China's 145 million mobile phone users were the largest in the world. After surpassing Japan in 2002, China is expected to overtake the United States as the world's largest PC market.</p>

<p>In the past thirty or so years, "Made in China" products have moved past toys, clothing, and shows, and now include consumer electronic and high-tech products. In 2003, Chinese high-tech exports valued at 113 billion US dollars.</p>

<p>In 2001, China became a member of the World Trade Organization. The country became more integrated into the world economy, yet it would face a much fiercer international competition. However, can the Chinese economy and its high-tech industry sustain such high-speed growth? In the 21st century, how is China developing its indigenous technological industry to support its competitiveness in world markets? Let us examine the country's smartphone, social media, and e-commerce markets to address these two questions.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/xiaomi.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="inchinatherearesmartphoneseverywhereliterallyeverywhere">In China, there are smartphones everywhere. Literally everywhere.</h4>

<p>Umeng, a Chinese analytics firm, confirmed that, by the end of 2013, <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/13/china-now-has-700m-active-smartphone-users-says-umeng/' >the number of active smartphones in China exceeded 700 million</a>. Because China has the <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/china-beats-u-s-in-q3-becomes-largest-smartphone-market-by-volume/' >world's largest number of active smartphone users</a>, many domestic and international companies want to grab a slice of this lucrative market.</p>

<p>As the price of smartphones drastically decreases, more first-time users are buying their first smartphones. A majority, close to 57% of Android devices sold in China last year were lower than $350. High-end smartphones were priced at $500, accounting for 27% of smartphones sold last year; of that amount, 80% were Apple iPhones. In the Android marketplace, Korean-based Samsung and Chinese-based <a href='http://xiaomi.com/' >Xiaomi</a> dominated.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's smartphones are currently sold in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. However, its hiring of a new Vice President of Xiaomi Global shows that the three-year old company plans to strengthen its competitiveness in international markets. Xiaomi's track record of rapid growth and saavy marketing indicates that this Chinese-based company will quickly become a mighty competitor in the US smartphone market.</p>

<p>The dream of Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun is to build <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/28/xiaomi-what-americans-need-to-know/' >a smartphone company that can compete with Apple</a>. Despite China's reputation for manufacturing low-cost, low-quality goods, Lei Jun wants to push the idea that China has the ability to manufacture high-end hardware.</p>

<p><a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/xiaomi-beats-samsung-to-top-chinas-smartphone-charts/' >Xiaomi challenges Samsung</a> in the Chinese smartphone marketplace. In the later half of 2013, Xiaomi's Mi 2S was the most popular smartphone in the Chinese market, followed by Samsung's Galaxy S4.</p>

<p>Xiaomi's successful sales can be contributed to the company's willingness to try alternative marketing strategies. By utilizing social media to gather user feedback, Xiaomi has also gained a loyal fanbase. Yet, Xiaomi still needs to prove the competitive advantage of its smartphones on the international market.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/alibaba.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="thechineseloveonlineshopping">The Chinese love online shopping.</h4>

<p>According to <a href='http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/asia-pacific/china_e-tailingw' >McKinsey</a>, China has the world's second largest e-commerce market, with estimates as high as $210 billion for revenues in 2012 and a compound annual growth rate of 120% since 2003. Almost 90% of Chinese electronic retailing occurs on virtual marketplaces. These sprawling e-commerce platforms offer products and services to consumers.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba' >Alibaba</a> is China's leading e-commerce company, operating the world's largest marketplace for both international and domestic Chinese trade. This company is focused on fostering an open, collaborative, and prosperous e-commerce system that benefits consumers, merchants, and the economy.</p>

<p>Alibaba wants to become <a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/us-alibaba-tsai-insight-idUSBREA3124K20140402' >a more global company</a>. It has already changed the way China shops，and also wants to transform the country's service industry, adding even more users to the company's group of 300 million customers. Alibaba has its <a href='http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/23/chinese-e-commerce-giant-alibaba-establishes-venture-division-in-u-s-looking-for-more-investments/' >sights set firmly on the US market</a>, establishing an investment organization to expand the company's overseas influence and competitiveness. This year, the company has begun the process of an <a href='http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/16/chinese-e-commerce-titan-alibaba-confirms-u-s-ipo/' >initial public offering</a> in the United States, with economists valuing the company at $110 billion.</p>

<p>If Alibaba has seemed unstoppable in its 15-year rise, an IPO will could make one of the world's most important high-tech companies face its most serious challenges so far. Alibaba's strategy of building its own global e-commerce empire, with its own financial services, has attracted close scrutiny from China's regulators and resistance from the country's banks. Alibaba's executive vice chairman says that the company's strategy has a single focus: to boost Alibaba's core e-commerce platform, especially as consumers shop more on smartphones.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/sina-weibo.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="chinaiskingofsocialmediahowironic">China is king of social media. How ironic.</h4>

<p>China does not have Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube. Yet, China has the <a href='http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/understanding_social_media_in_china' >world's largest active environment</a> for social media. More than 300 million people use social medial including blogs, social networks, microblogs, online communities, etc. China's Internet users spend more than 40% of their time online for social media, a number that continues to rise rapidly.</p>

<p>Social media began in China around 1994 with online communities and forums, and in 1994, shifted towards instant messaging. Blogging began in 2004, and a year later, social networks with chatting capabilities, such as Ren Ren, were established. In 2009, Sina Weibo launched microblogging with multimedia service.</p>

<p>This explosive growth shows few signs of abating. It is harder for the Chinese government to censor social media than other information channels. Because many Chinese citizens are somewhat skeptical of the authority of governments and formal institutions, users disproportionately direct more respect towards opinion leaders on social media.</p>

<p>Sina Weibo is among China's fastest growing and <a href='http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/02/weibo-china-twitter-chinese-microblogging-tom-cruise-201202' >most talked about social media</a>, often referred to as China's Twitter and Facebook. In just four short years, Weibo has attracted over 500 million users, including ordinary people, celebrities, and other public figures, as well as organizations, such as media, businesses, governments, and charities.</p>

<p>However, Weibo confines itself in China, having amassed a huge user base in China and Chinese communities abroad. Besides Sina introducing an English-version of Weibo and allowing users to login through Facebook, Weibo has made no effort in expanding to foreign markets, rather focusing on recruiting users within China. New research suggests that Sina may need to re-consider its strategy: Weibo seems to have peaked in popularity. Weibo's domestic competitor, Tencent's WeChat, <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/07/wechat-not-weibo-is-the-chinese-social-network-to-watch/278212/' >poses a threat to Weibo's competitiveness in the social media market</a>.</p>

<p>Tencent's Wechat was first launched in late 2011. During its first two years, WeChat already accumulated over 300 million years. It approaches a completely different strategy than Weibo: going directly to the international market to sell its product. However, Weibo is very massive and popular in China, and also serves as the most active and powerful Chinese platform for public expression.</p>

<p>This year, Sina Weibo <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/sina-weibo-chinas-answer-to-facebook-and-twitter-files-for-500m-ipo-in-the-u-s/' >fundraised $500 million in preparation for its IPO</a>. Weibo also has the <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/alibaba-bans-tencent-wechat/' >support of Alibaba</a> in the social media market. Alibaba holds an 18% stake in Weibo, having stopped the use of WeChat seller-side services, and allowing Weibo users to directly buy products from Taobao. In addition, from an international perspective, China's Weibo has a greater influence than United-States based Twitter. In fact, <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/twitters-international-revenue-is-skyrocketing-but-the-company-is-worried-about-sina-weibo-and-line/' >Twitter worries that its Chinese counterpart might actually impede its international growth</a>.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/china-flag.png'  alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="madeinchinalookslikeatechwinner">"Made in China" looks like a tech winner.</h4>

<p>From the Chinese market perspective of smartphones, e-commerce, and social media, the growth of China's tech industry has been quick and mighty. Web-based products have also been well received by Chinese citizens, enabling domestic businesses to hold a significant market share. Indigenous products are fierce competitors with their foreign counterparts, and Chinese companies, such as Alibaba, have invested heavily in indigenous products to expand their overseas influence and competitiveness.</p>

<p>In terms of the smartphone, e-commerce and social media markets, the Chinese economy and its high-tech sector have not only maintained their rapid growth, but through their clever marketing, design, and business strategies, have also captured international acclaim. However, on the increasingly competitive international market, Chinese companies must devote more sources to research and development to keep up and surpass their foreign rivals.</p>

<p>Chinese tech companies need to realize that <a href='http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/34627/71441670.pdf?sequence=1' >their local knowledge is a source of competitive advantage</a>, and that they must take advantage of this expertise. Companies with global aspirations need to develop an international brand to promote high-quality and reliable products.</p>

<p>At the end of 2013, <a href='http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/01/16/chinas-internet-population-numbered-618m-end-2013-81-connecting-via-mobile/' >China's Internet population reached 618 million, with 81% through mobile</a>. An increasingly connected country provides more opportunities for tech innovation in the likes of Alibaba, Xiaomi and Sina Weibo.</p>

<p>So, what's going to be the next "Made in China" high-tech gadget?</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/05/01/the-tech-giants-of-china/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7aba597c-8a52-4b6a-b968-58c9c80d8570</guid><category><![CDATA[Tech]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 01:04:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hack the Mind By Loving]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Hack the mind by living, laughing, learning, and <strong>loving</strong>.</em></p>

<h2 id="loving">Loving.</h2>

<p>Love is expressed through actions, and experienced through emotions. However, there is no one way to define the essence of love. </p>

<p>Love encompasses sympathy, determination, tolerance, patience, support, confidence and so much more. If a person wants to truly express love, he or she must first learn to love oneself, to love the world, and to love mankind.</p>

<p>If a person wishes for more love in their lives, the person must learn to accept the past. You must not let past things hold you back from finding true love and happiness. Once you have accepted the past, forgive and forget, and move on.</p>

<p>When finding love, one must be open-minded and consider the qualities of a person that does not initially meet the eye. One must remember that no one is perfect, and never close the door on a new opportunity. </p>

<p>Take a fresh look at all the people you encounter in your daily life, and you might discover someone as a love potential. At first, potential may not seem as exciting as love at first sight. However, give this potential time, and it might just blossom into the most stable and beautiful love you have ever experienced.</p>

<p>To love others, you must first learn to love yourself. You should learn how to experience love, build self-confidence, and change your bad habits. Do something good for someone else so that you can become a better person. To respect yourself is to love yourself. Remember that no one in this world perfect. However, if you learn to love yourself, people will notice the change through your behavior and interaction with them. Once you love yourself, then you are worth being loved by others.</p>

<p>Once you begin a relationship, you must learn how to contribute to the relationship because love is shared between two people. Love has its ups and downs. A lover will bring you joy and happiness, but he or she can also hurt you. </p>

<p>If you want true love, you must learn to open your heart and trust your loved one. Do not keep secrets from each other. Do not pretend what you are not. Do not lie to each other. Give your lover the chance to know the real you.</p>

<p>Lastly, you need to give love time. Do not force the feeling of love. Do not hastily rush into relationship. This will only leave you feeling discontent and empty in the relationship. Love takes patience and endurance.</p>

<p><em>Love is waiting. You only need to find it.</em></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>

<p>I know that what I wrote above may be sappy, cliched, or completely unrealistic. But, it is my perception on love.</p>

<p>Having attended my very first wedding this past March, I know that happily ever after is not a fairy tale.</p>

<p>Love takes time, effort, money, and energy. But I believe that if you put everything into a relationship with someone who both your gut, mind, and heart tells you to go after, what do you have to lose on love?</p>

Bitcoin? WTF?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>My little Bitcoin 101. This cryptocurrency is pretty darn intriguing.</p>

<p><strong>What is currency?</strong></p>

<p>Currency refers to the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use. Specifically, the term is synonymous with money in any form that is used or circulated as a viable medium of exchange.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>What is Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized digital currency that relies on cryptography to provide instantaneous peer-to-peer transactions anywhere in the world. Satoshi Nakamoto published the specification for the open-source platform in 2009. Bitcoin’s design is public, nobody owns or controls the virtual currency, and everyone can take part in its development and use.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Um63OQz3bjo'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><strong>Why are people going nuts about Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>There are many advantages to Bitcoin. Its transactions require no bank or clearing house approval. It can be used anywhere as long as you have internet access. Your Bitcoin account cannot be frozen as a result of governmental action. And there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits associated with opening and maintaining a Bitcoin account.</p>

<p><strong>How do I start using Bitcoin?</strong></p>

<p>Download a Bitcoin wallet! A Bitcoin wallet allows you to transact with other users and gives you ownership of a balance with which you can send and receive Bitcoins. You can install a Bitcoin wallet on your phone, tablet, and/or computer. Desktop wallets give you complete control over your wallet, but you are responsible for protecting your money and performing backups. Mobile wallets allow you to bring Bitcoin with you on-the-go. Web-based wallets allow you to use Bitcoin on any browser or mobile and may provide additional services and support as well.</p>

<p>Once you have your Bitcoin wallet installed, it will generate your first Bitcoin address. You can let your friends know of your Bitcoin address so they can pay you and vice versa. It is like how email works, but Bitcoin addresses are only meant to be used once. Don’t worry, you can always generate another Bitcoin addresses when you need it.</p>

<p><strong>How does a Bitcoin transaction work?</strong></p>

<p>The Bitcoin network relies on the block chain, a shared public ledger that includes all confirmed transactions. Users rely on the block chain to calculate their Bitcoin balance and to verify new transactions. Cryptography is employed to enforce the integrity and  chronology of the block chain.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin-peer-to-peer-network.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>A Bitcoin transaction involves a transfer of values between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets maintain a private key used to sign transactions, providing mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents transactions from being altered by anyone else once they have been issued.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/bitcoin-wallet-set-address.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>How are Bitcoin transactions processed?</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions are processed through mining, which involves utilizing computer hardware to do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network. These calculations are used to confirm waiting transactions that get included in the block chain.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/GmOzih6I1zs'  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Confirmation means that a transaction has been processed and is highly unlikely to be reversible. In order for a transaction to be confirmed, transactions must be packed into a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules, which must then be verified by the network.</p>

<p>As a reward, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees, as well as newly created Bitcoins, for their efforts. Bitcoin mining is a specialized and competitive market where miners are rewarded in proportion to the amount of work they’ve done. Not all Bitcoin users are Bitcoin miners. In fact, the mining market has become quite saturated as Bitcoin prices continue to surge.</p>

Here's why.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/heartbleed.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Earlier this week, a researcher at Google Security and Finnish security firm <a href='http://www.codenomicon.com/' >Codenomicon</a> discovered the <a href='http://heartbleed.com/' >Heartbleed</a> bug in OpenSSL, a widely used open-source software that is used to encrypt sensitive information, like emails, passwords and credit card numbers.</p>

<p>Because of the Heartbleed bug, a huge chunk of the Internet is vulnerable to cyber attacks. So with one attack, a hacker can grab 64kb of memory from a server and leave no trace of ever doing so. Imagine how much information can be accessed over repeatable exploits. Scary? No, this is <strong>catastrophic</strong>.</p>

<p>Apparently, this security flaw in OpenSSL has been around for 2 years, affecting over 2/3 of sites and services, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Yahoo, that depend on OpenSSL for encryption. According to security expert, <a href='https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html' >Bruce Schneier</a>, "On the scale of 1 to 10, this [Heartbleed] is an 11."</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The Heartbleed Bug effectively means past SSL traffic can be decrypted, unless it used Perfect Forward Secrecy. <a href='http://t.co/PCREwSltRJ' >http://t.co/PCREwSltRJ</a> ಠ_ಠ</p>&mdash; Mathias Bynens (@mathias) <a href='https://twitter.com/mathias/statuses/453380256540663808' >April 8, 2014</a></blockquote>  

<script async src='http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'  charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In other words, the Heartbleed bug comprises your privacy online - big time. All your past, present, and future communications on at least half a million sites can be <strong>seen by anyone.</strong> Even with Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled, your past data is still vulnerable.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/heartbleed-xkcd.png'  alt="" /></p>

<p>As programmers around the world are busy patching up their systems with a bug-free version of OpenSSL, the best thing for you to do to protect your data online is to <strong>change your passwords IMMEDIATELY.</strong> You can also test for your vulnerability at afflicted sites <a href='http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/' >here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="asmallrantontheweather">A Small Rant on the Weather.</h4>

<p>North Carolina is known for its awesomely bipolar weather.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/durham-cloudy.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>About a week ago, the weather was close to the freezing point. This week, Durham decided to skip spring and jump straight into summer.</p>

<p><img src='http://annayliu.com/content/images/2014/Apr/durham-sunny.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>I'm actually really cool with that - except all angiosperms on campus decided to flower - and that means pollen...pollen everywhere.</p>

<h4 id="withaprilcomesallergiesandmore">With April comes allergies and more...</h4>

<p>Besides the incessant amount of pollen abound, April will be even crazier than March.</p>

<p>First off, it's going to be my last semester in college. <strong>MY LAST SEMESTER.</strong> This is unbelievable. These past four years have been gone in the blink of an eye. I am both excited and terrified that I will be attending my own graduation in a month.</p>

<p>In April, I plan to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create my own infectious disease that could potentially wipe out the entire human population</li>
<li>Attend <a href='http://bases.stanford.edu/e-bootcamp/' >Entrepreneurship Bootcamp</a> at Stanford University with other like-minded student entrepreneurs from all over the world</li>
<li>Celebrate my very last day of classes at Duke EDM (electronic dance music) style with Dillon Francis</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="newstuffcoming">New stuff coming.</h4>

<p>I admit that I have not been publishing on a regular schedule. I have been brainstorming and writing.</p>

<p>Some things to look forward to in the upcoming months:</p>

<ul>
<li>The last post in my Hack the Mind series on love. </li>
<li>Exploring the movie <em>Her</em> and falling in love with an artificially intelligent being</li>
<li>What makes the best mobile apps so addicting</li>
<li><em>Hatching Twitter</em> and the drama of starting the company of 140 characters</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>4.9.2014 Update:</strong> the allergies are real.</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/04/03/on-march-april-and-allergies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ecbccffc-fb99-4ebf-b8f4-72f59b9f6c4c</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2014 08:39:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hack the Mind By Learning]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Hack your mind by living, laughing, <strong>learning</strong>, and loving.</em></p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning.</h2>

<p>Seriously, learning is the best way to not only exercise your brain but also a chance for you to <strong>invest in yourself.</strong></p>

<p>Education will enable you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become more aware of what goes on in the world</li>
<li>Discover and develop your passion</li>
<li>Provide you with the tools and strategies to help you get ahead of the game</li>
</ul>

<p>College has been my academic playground. Since day one at Duke, I made it my goal to discover what I would be truly passionate about.</p>

<p>Finding out what I wanted to do with my life was no easy task. I considered at least over ten majors (from biomedical engineering to classical studies), took classes in a broad array of subjects, and explored many potential career paths.</p>

<p>Along the way, I made mistakes, but I learned more about myself with each new educational opportunity that I pursued.</p>

<p>Although I decided to declare a double major in biology and computer science near the end of my sophomore year, I didn't know what I wanted to do this degree until the first semester of my senior year.</p>

<p>Last semester, I decided to take a break from my extracurricular activities and invest my time learning about startups and companies in Silicon Valley. By doing so, I realized that there was more to the tech industry than just being a software developer.</p>

<p>I caught the startup bug. I discovered a new frontier of creativity and innovation that lay in the heart of my most favorite city in the world: San Francisco.</p>

<p>I love to code and I love to build. I have greater ambitions than just coding and building. I want to learn how to channel my creativity to impact the world. And I want to learn how to utilize my passion for technology to create innovative products for people to lead healthy, productive, and exciting lives.</p>

<p>I don't know where life will take me, but I know that all the learning opportunities that I pursued at Duke have brought me to where I am today. I want to create and innovate, and my studies at Duke have provided me with the skills and toolset to do so.</p>

<p>Near the conclusion of my college career, I have finally discovered what I want to do with my life. And I will make learning my lifelong endeavor to turn my ultimate dreams and aspirations into reality.</p>

<p>I once received an email from a professor at Duke who wrote that she learned best by investing in her <em>time</em> and <em>money</em>. I agree wholeheartedly. Attending Duke University and pursuing two majors in the STEM fields are two of the best decisions I have made in my life.</p>

<p>I will keep on learning. I will continue to put my learning to good use. I will continue to invest myself through learning.</p>

<p><em>Put your heart and soul into your endeavors, and they will bear you fruitful results.</em></p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/03/15/hack-the-mind-by-learning/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6eb7323c-c848-4cab-a098-79cbc08d584d</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 15:41:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hack the Mind By Laughing]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Hack your mind by living, <strong>laughing</strong>, learning, and loving.</em></p>

<h2 id="laughing">Laughing.</h2>

<p>LOL (laughing out loud) is the three letter acronym that has been incorporated into my vernacular.</p>

<p>Laughing is the best way to convey your happiness and to release stress. It will help you lift the burden from your shoulders and free you from your worries.</p>

<p>Reseach on laughter has shown that laughter can help keep our bodies strong and disease resistant. A good laugh exercises many muscles in your face and causes the brain to release endorphins, which will elevate your mood and make you happy.</p>

<p>Simply put, laughing improves your longevity, thus giving you even more chances to pursue the life that you have always envisioned. The positive side effects of laughter include reduced blood pressure, decreased blood glucose, the dulling of pain, the alleviation of stress and anxiety, and an improved feeling of well being.</p>

<p>Listen up, especially for you fitness fanatics out there, laughing will help you burn those calories. A healthy laugh session can be equal to a couple of minutes on an exercising machine. In addition, when you laugh, you are also conditioning your diaphragm, abdominals, respiratory, facial, leg and back muscles. Now that's a workout you can do without a drop of sweat!</p>

<p>Laughing can help you feel and look better. So why not turn that frown upside down, and laugh out loud?</p>

<p>And if you want a laughing challenge, try ROFL (rolling on floor laughing) and LMFAO (laughing my #$@! <em>beep</em> off).</p>]]></description><link>http://annayliu.com/2014/03/15/hack-the-mind-by-laughing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c754710b-da6d-47a3-b998-272beaba00ae</guid><category><![CDATA[Thoughts On Life]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anna Liu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 15:31:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
