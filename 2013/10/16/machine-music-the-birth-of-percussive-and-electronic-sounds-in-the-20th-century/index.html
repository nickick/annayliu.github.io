            <p>The early twentieth century can be described as a period of great music diversity. Composers, while taking advantage of newly available resources and technologies, reinvented traditional music forms and created new ones. Although influenced by the works of the past, they sought to break away from traditional methods of classical composition through such techniques as the redefinition of chordal construction, the liberation of dissonance in harmonies, and the spontaneity of melodic passages and tempos.</p>

<p>Perhaps, even more radical was the technologically-driven, avant-garde pursuits of a select group of composers and inventors such as the likes of Leon Theremin, Luigi Russolo, and Edgard Varese. Here, we will explore the novel musical instruments that arose during the early twentieth century and the incorporation of percussive and electronic sounds into musical composition in an attempt to understand how such works sought to capture the sights, sounds, and experiences of the modern world.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w5qf9O6c20o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In the above clip, depicting one of the first attempts to introduce experimental sounds as inspired by modernity, we see Leon Theremin, a Russian inventor and physicist, exhibiting his namesake creation, the theremin, considered to be one of the earliest, mass-produced electronic musical instruments. During his tenure at the Physical Technical Institute in Petrograd, he experimented heavily with the properties of electromagnetism. In 1919, while building a high-frequency radio oscillator, he discovered that the device’s pitch would change whenever its electromagnetic field was disrupted by the movement of his hands (Glinksy). Thus, the theremin was born.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X-ywH1Vj8_U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As demonstrated by musician, Pamela Kurstin, in her 2002 TED talk, the theremin is played without physical contact of the instrument. The musician controls the instrument’s pitch (frequency) and volume (amplitude) by the relative positioning of her hands. The pitch of the theremin increases as she moves her hand closer to the vertical antenna; as she moves her right hand closer to horizontal looped antenna, the sound that emanates from the instrument becomes softer. Due to its lack of visual or physical cues in producing a wide range and variety of sounds, the theremin is considered by music enthusiasts as the world’s most difficult instrument to master. Even as a virtuoso, Kurstin points out the high level of concentration and precision required to perform music with the instrument.</p>

<p>Kurstin’s intricate performance in the TED talk also alludes to the theremin’s initial popularity when Theremin travelled to the United States to promote his invention. Theremin envisioned his instrument to play serious classical music, and to even replace entire orchestras, as it was marketed to be the “next universal musical instrument” by its mass-producer, RCA Corporation (Taub). The novelty of the instrument attracted avant-garde composers, among them Ukrainian Joseph Schillinger, who recognized its potential and wrote many pieces, including his <em>First Airphonic Suite</em>, to feature the theremin (Beckerman).</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/35213636&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

<p>Schillinger’s Suite, performed by Theremin and the Cleveland Orchestra in its 1929 premiere, not only demonstrates the instrument’s flexibility and freedom to generate a gliding range of sounds over many octaves, but also reveals its capability to produce extremely subtle expressions in the performance of classical repertoire.  Despite its immense appeal in the music world, the theremin lost momentum as a consumer product due to the high-learning curve involved in mastering the instrument. However, its invention was a powerful inspiration for later developments in electronic musical sounds. Even today, a performance on the theremin instills an air of magic in its audience.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-YeE3WVoz64" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In 1930, Leon Theremin also collaborated with American composer Henry Cowell to create the rhythmicon, hailed as the world’s first electronic drum machine and possessed the capability to transform harmonic intervals into rhythmic beats, and vice versa. Cowell, known for his use of experimental expressions and rhythms in his works, commissioned Theremin to create  an instrument that could generate multiple rhythmic patterns impossible for one person to simultaneously produce by hand on an existing acoustic or percussive instrument. Cowell’s purpose for the rhythmicon was twofold: first, to use the instrument to incorporate rhythmic melodies and harmonies into classical composition and, two to carry out “scientific  physical and psychological experiments with rhythm” unheard of by any known contemporary means (Smith).</p>

<p>Cowell, intent on proving the usefulness of the rhythmicon, wrote a variety of pieces featuring the instrument, most notably Rhythmicana (renamed as Concerto for Rhythmicon and Orchestra) which he completed in 1931 (Baron and Buffington). Rhythmicana is a suite composed of four, very individualized movements, with each movement contrasting in the types of instruments required for performance and the specific modes of musical organization (Smith). It was a piece representative of its time, effortlessly showcasing the multi-faceted, intricate rhythmic delicacies of the rhythmicon.</p>

<p>Although the rhythmicon caused a stir in the musical world, like the theremin, it did not garner widespread adoption and appreciation due to its lack of ability in producing appealing, emotional music. Despite the instrument’s contribution to rhythmic development, its sounds were characterized as too synthetic and mechanical, like “a cross between a grunt and a snort in the low ‘tones’ and like an Indian war whoop in the high tones” (Smith).  However, its significance lies in the fact that it predated the existence of the first commercially available rhythm machine by thirty years and marked another step towards the birth of electronic music during the early twentieth century.</p>

<p>While composers Cowell and Schillinger and inventor Theremin focused on the incorporation of electronic sounds into classical music, Italian composer, Luigi Russolo, and French-born composer, Edgar Varese embraced new musical instruments to create novel genres of music, though they differed in their respective approaches. On the one hand, Varese, dubbed as the father of electronic music, envisaged the cooperation of engineers with musicians to innovate musical instruments that would enable the development and expansion of novel technical capabilities in composition as reflective of the modern era. On the other hand, Russolo,  known as one of the first noise music composers in the Italian Futurism movement,  devised his own noise-generating devices, the Intonarumori, and desired to escape the confinements of traditional melodic music through mechanical sounds inspired by the machinery of the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Varese’s compositions exemplifies his mastery of timbre and rhythm and his attempts to characterize sound as “living matter” (Chou). He believed that the building of new electronic musical instruments, as well as the incorporation of what may be regarded as ‘non-musical’ or concrete sounds, i.e. the machine-like noises utilized by Russolo, provided greater opportunities for the composer to liberate his musical imagination from the limiting sound-producing capabilities of conventional orchestral instruments. However, he challenged Russolo’s direct use of noise in composition. Instead of embracing sound in its raw, unaltered form,  he sought to transform noise into music as “organized sound,” emphasizing that it not the job of the composer to liberate the natural and physical constructs of sound, but rather to combine and infuse them to create new musical forms (Pape).</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/a9mg4KHqRPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Varese’s <em>Ionisation</em> effectively features a ‘‘pulsation of a vitality emanating from a thousand sources,” reflecting the myriad of seemingly chaotic molecular interactions occurring at the atomic level that still give rise to unified structures (Pape). In this piece, we can hear the expansions and variations in the pitches of contrasting percussive sounds in the ensemble, ranging from the gradual roar of the sirens to the sudden clashes of the cymbals. Yet, we can still discern musical structure from the intense intermingling and interlocking of timbre and rhythm. Ionisation demonstrates Varese’s achievement in not only his “differentiation of colours and densities,” but also his success in creating a novel musical experience that emphasizes the spatial construction of sounds rather than the harmonic interdependencies of notes (Pape). Despite his contrasting perspectives of music composition from that of Russolo’s, Varese acknowledges that Ionisation was partially influenced by Russolo, who captured the essence and properties of noise music in L’arte dei Rumori (Radice).</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VHLmitA3o6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Like Varese’s Ionisation, Russolo’s Veglio Di Una Città, was created using an ensemble of mechanical sounds, but the piece was arranged to forgo conventional music instruments altogether and seems to lack any recognizable form of compositional structure. Throughout Veglio Di Una Citta, we can hear the crackling, buzzing, gurgling, and roaring of a variety of intonarumori, acoustic noise generators that could be used to create and control in dynamic and pitch the different kinds of sounds as enumerated in the composer’s manifesto,  L’arte dei Rumori.  In this piece, the composer effectively breaks free of what he considers as the “restrictive circle of pure sounds” and imaginatively embraces the “infinite variety of noise-sounds” (Russolo).</p>

<p>Although Russolo thought that man’s heavy exposure to machinery has enabled him to gain a greater appreciation for the complex sounds that arise in an urban environment, his noise-music compositions were met with strong disapproval from his audience and incited violence among its listeners (Goldsmith). Perhaps the composer was too progressive in his thinking as he assumed that man would substantially obtain more pleasure from the raw urban sounds of his noise-music than the melodic lines of classical music (Russolo). Nonetheless, Russolo and his intonarumori reflect yet another exemplary effort in revolutionizing the traditional musical experience and innovating modern sounds through novel mechanical techniques.</p>

<p>Theremin, Cowell, Schillinger, Russolo, and Varese. These men were musical visionaries who were eager to capture the sounds and experiences of the modern world through the creation of new listening experiences. The scientific and technological innovations of the earliest twentieth century heavily influenced the use of percussive and electronic sounds in their compositions. And whether it was the invention of the theremin to the liberation of the composer’s imagination through non-conventional sounds, the works of these inventor-composers took a radical shift from the classical music traditions of the past and ushered in a modern era of ingenious artistry.</p>
