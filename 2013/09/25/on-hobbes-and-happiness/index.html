            <p>In this essay, I will attempt to explore how happiness shapes human nature and the Hobbesian state of nature, and the role that happiness plays in the formation of a society based on Hobbes’ social contract theory as described in the <em>Leviathan</em>.</p>

<p>Human beings possess natural passions that drive our behavior; such passions include hope, ambition, fear, impulse, and desire. The old moral philosophers, such as Aristotle, believed that because everything had a place in the world, such passions would enable an individual to achieve his ultimate purpose in life. In the end, his happiness would be derived from this actualization of his potentiality; the individual has discovered the true meaning of his life because he has followed his passions and fulfilled his destiny. The passions that characterize man drives him towards the good, which was, in the eyes of the ancient philosophers, towards discovering his purpose in life, and being able to contribute to society what he was originally destined to do. This actualization of potentiality principle implies that in a natural state of things, an individual’s fate is pre-determined, and that the purpose of his life is to achieve the potential that he was naturally endowed with, a potential that is unique to his own life, and to find happiness after he realizes his natural place in society. Thus, because it is the natural tendency of man, driven by his passions, to actualize his characteristic potentiality, then society and/or civilization is also a work of nature, which can be perceived as an amalgamation of each member’s contribution to the greater good through his individual sense of fulfillment in life.</p>

<p>Given the historical context of Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em> (i.e. a time of great upheaval and civil war in England), such an optimist outlook on human nature may have seemed, at the very least, absurd and far-fetched. As depicted in Chapter 11 of the <em>Leviathan</em>, Hobbes rejected the idea of “finis ultimus (utmost aim)” or “summum bonum (greatest good)” as spoken by the ancient philosophers; to him, “felicity is a continual progress of the desire from one object to another, the attaining of the former being still but the way to the latter.” There is no such thing as working towards the greater good (in the form of society or civilization), and happiness is not derived from achieving one’s ultimate purpose in life, if given any. In fact, considering Hobbes’ pessimistic take on the nature of man (“the life of man [is], solitary, poor, nasty brutish, and short”), does an ultimate purpose of life even exist? At the end of our lives, do we truly sense a fulfillment in our lives, or is life just a restless, meaningless quest of procuring one pleasure after another in our insecurity to assure a contented life? Even at the end of one day, are we satisfied simply by what we have accomplished in a day’s work, or are we satisfied because we have accomplished a given task today, we are ready to pursue whatever that comes next tomorrow? Hobbes gives a “general inclination of all mankind a perpetual and restless desire of power after power;” humans are addicted to seeking pleasures and gratifying desires: after tasting a small piece of chocolate, our carnal craving expands indefinitely as we are never fully satisfied from the next piece of chocolate, and the next piece after that. We are forever tantalized by even the remote thought of a future desire. Because we are driven by our natural passions to consistently pursue goal after goal, seeking purpose after purpose, in inevitably repeated cycles, our lives, and the natural state of man, are miserable at best. From this cynical perspective of life, we seek ephemeral happiness after happiness, yet there is not enough happiness to go around for everyone. Man cannot actualize his potential, because there is not a defined potential to begin with, and life ends up as a harsh, endless chase of desires “that ceaseth only in death.</p>

<p>In the <em>Leviathan</em>, Hobbes writes “And thus much for the ill condition which man by mere nature is actually placed in; though with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the passions, partly in his reason (Chapter 13).” The ill-condition of man that Hobbes describes is <em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em>—a war of all against all—that is rooted in man’s perpetual quest to pursue desire after desire, but can never be fully satisfied because happiness (that exists through sexual, carnal, political, and etc., forms) is limited. Unlike the ancient philosophers, Hobbes begins with the premise that nature has endowed every man with equal faculties in strength or mind; for example, what one man lacks in strength can be made up in mind, and vice versa. However, an equal distribution of ability in men does not necessarily indicate an equal distribution of happiness among men.  Man consistently lives in a state of competition with each other because happiness cannot be split equally among its constituents; what is desired by two cannot be shared by two, and thus the two become enemies. What arises from man’s endless pursuit of happiness (derived from a limited quantity of pleasure and power available) is a destructive impulse; because happiness cannot be equally enjoyed by two, the two will “endeavor to destroy or subdue one another” until one is completely satisfied (or alive), and other is fully unsatisfied (or dead). After a brief happiness has been experienced, the victor seeks to obtain another pleasure, undoubtedly pursued by many like him, and yet another battle over a common desire ensues. Such battles between men will cycle repeatedly, because man will never be fulfilled as he pursues one pleasure after another. Such is the condition of war in which a man’s natural passions drives his vain pursuit of happiness unchecked and pits himself in a constant battle of him against the world. Such is a state of nature in which man has the liberty to preserve his unrequited happiness at the expense of everything else, and finds the only solace in his life to be thoughts of death.</p>

<p>It is possible to escape a state of nature characterized by a war of all against war through one of two ways. The first choice is death. Death can put an immediate stop to a life of continuous yearning for desires, but if a man’s life is terminated, then he is deprived of the possibility to even experience happiness, no matter how short-lived or unsatisfactory that happiness may be. The alternative is compromise, driven by “the passions that incline men to peace.” Men can sacrifice their individual pursuits of pleasure, terminate the battles fought over shared desires, and work together to establish a common power dedicated to preserving peace and justice. Through such compromise arises Hobbes’ social contract theory, in which men have consented to surrender a portion of their happiness (freedoms) and to submit to the authority of a governing body in exchange for the protection of the remainder of their happiness (natural rights). The legitimate power dedicates itself in setting “the notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice” so that man can continue to seek happiness in his life without harming the happiness of another. Those individuals that seek happiness at the expense of others will be condemned by authority in their attempt to infringe upon the natural rights of his fellow man, and the actions that proceed from destructive, warlike impulses will be forbidden by law in their attempt to uproot the foundations of a mutual pact based on men’s personal sacrifice for the common good. The society that arises from a social contract theory functions to preserve society, and does not seek to suppress the natural passions of man that drives him to pursue pleasure as long as he continues to endeavor for peace. The establishment of a society based on a mutual transferring of rights among men quells the passions that incline men to war against one another in Hobbes’ state of nature, because such a society was built upon the agreement of its constituents to defend their security, life, and happiness.</p>

<p>Although Hobbes depicts the ill-condition of man as a war of all against all, he does not characterize human nature with the innate desire to kill or destroy, but rather confirms that “the desires, and other passions of man, are in themselves no sin.” Each man has the liberty to use his own power, in his own judgment and reason, to preserve his own nature and life through fitting means. Part of man’s innate nature is to pursue desires, and the circumstances that arise from men pursuing their individual desires drive men to preserve his own life against his enemies through whatever cost. In an ideal world, every man’s desire would be fulfilled, “every man is contented with his share,” and happiness is equally distributed among every person. However, in reality, this is not so. Because there are only so many things in the world that can provide happiness to men, happiness is limited, and thus, not every man’s desires can be satisfied. And because man will never truly be gratified by the satisfaction of one desire, he will always be looking to take another bite of the apple, even if there are not enough bites for everyone. Thus, the root of competition, which subsequently leads to the consequential fate of war, among men is not the natural passions that drive them to seek desires, but the never-ending pursuit of desires that pits them against one another, and which results in what Hobbes dubs as the “three principal causes of quarrel.” First, a man is unhappy because his desire is not satisfied, and he may use violence against others to gain that brief happiness. Second, once a man is in a momentary state of happiness, he may want to defend his state of happiness from envious others. Thirdly, because a man is happy from satisfying a desire, he may want to reveal his happiness to others, but by doing so, he may make his peers unhappy and resentful of his happiness. Such antagonistic relationships among men are detrimental to their livelihood, and cause them to lead short, insufferable lives in which more time is spent on pursuing happiness than experiencing happiness.</p>

<p>A society based on Hobbes’ social contract theory not only enables men to escape the condition of war as previously described, but also allows them to pursue their desires and enjoy the gratification of those desires without having to become weary of life. Man does not possess an innate natural passion for destruction. But without a common power to deem what is just and what is unjust, men will continue to commit such destructive actions “that proceed from those passions [that drive them to pursue happiness] till they know a law that forbids them.” However, such laws can only be made when men come together and mutually sacrifice a small part of their happiness for the happiness of the greater good as manifested in a peaceful society. An individual’s pursuit of happiness has the potential to create anarchy, and result in a short and miserable life, if one’s pursuit of happiness, either tacitly or deliberately, intrudes on the happiness of another. An individual’s pursuit of happiness has the potential to also instill harmony, and result in a long and pleasant life, if one voluntarily respects another’s pursuit of happiness, and strives to “seek peace and follow it.” If the latter occurs mutually among all the future constituents of a society, then an individual in such a society may live out a life in which he can experience countless moments of happiness after happiness without fear, and embrace death when it is his time to do so.</p>
