            <p><strong>Christianity: A Window of Opportunity for Virgin Women</strong></p>

<p>History is often perceived as <em>his</em> story, a recollection of the past from the male perspective. The difficulty of accurately portraying the female perspective can be attributed to two factors: one, the lack of precedence in placing scholarly attention on women’s history in primary sources, and two, the lack of primary sources from antiquity about women and by women (Kraemer 4). However, studies of ancient Christian texts, especially those known as the “apocryphal” writings, have provided insight into the complexities associated with women’s religious roles in society. One such piece is the “Acts of Thecla,” a story that recounts the adventures of a virgin woman named Thecla, who, as influenced by the apostle Paul during the rise of Christianity in the Greco-Roman era, abandons her fiancé to pursue a life of chastity and spirituality. Paul’s influence on Thecla leaves her in conflict: she is caught in the standards associated with women as defined by the social traditions of an old Greco-Roman world and the possibilities for women as brought by the development of a new Christian sphere within the old Greco-Roman world.</p>

<p>In the introduction in <em>Her Share of the Blessings</em>, Kraemer attempts to provide an analytic perspective on the diversity of women’s roles in religion during antiquity. In doing so, she draws on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas, who has created a model that correlates two factors, grid and group, in order to define the human social experience in terms of religious and cultural impacts. The “grid” measures the autonomy of an individual, while the “group” measures the degree to which an individual incorporates into society; together, these two factors combine to form four major combinations (Kraemer 13-15). Kraemer also expands upon the Douglas model by affirming that the “grid/group theory must be able to account for distinctions of class and race”—that is, at least in theory, whether different social constructs generate gender distinctions (Kraemer 20). Using Kraemer’s expansion of the Douglas model, two of the four major combinations can be used to describe Thecla’s old and new worlds. There is a strong sense of ascribed status and hierarchy in weak group, strong grid, characterized by distinct gender separations; in strong group, weak grid, the boundaries and identity of the group as a whole is apparent and defined, but specific gender distinctions are minimized because the an individual’s status  within the group is achieved, not ascribed (Kramer 15).  Weak group, strong grid best characterizes the older, but wider polytheistic Greco-Roman world that Thecla leaves behind; strong group, weak grid is best attributed to the newer, yet closer Christian community that Thecla pursues.</p>

<p>The Douglas model is a tool that can be used to analyze the catalytic influence of Paul’s message on Greco-Roman society, especially on virgin women of the old pagan world as depicted in the “Acts of Thecla.” In doing so, the Douglas model also reveals the changing roles experienced by early Christian women, predominantly by those with ascetic drive, in the context of Thecla’s conversion and subsequent actions. It is important to note that the application of the Douglas model reflects one version of Christianity at the time.</p>

<p>Thecla’s old Greco-Roman world can be attributed as weak group but strong grid due to the fact that “women and men usually operate in separate domains”; the public Greco-Roman world is patriarchal, while the private matriarchal (Kraemer 16). This dichotomy creates a problem for Thecla: Paul’s overwhelming influence on Thecla draws her out of a woman’s traditional place in the private sphere. Thecla faces the intense pressure from her family to conform to societal expectations–that is, to marry her fiancé Thamyris and fulfill the duties of a wife and mother. As Thecla sits by the window captivated by Paul’s message, her fiancé calls her to “come back to your Thamyris and be ashamed” (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 10). This serves to suggest her future place of inferiority if she conforms to societal expectations through marriage. She must remain subservient to her future husband, and thus her role in society itself is not only limited but also dependent of her future husband’s role in the public sphere. However, Paul’s message is catalytic in the fact that it sparks Thecla’s choice to abandon the many confining aspects of her old Greco-Roman world; the path of spirituality offered by Paul’s message promises bliss for “those who have kept the flesh chaste” (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 5). For young virgin women like Thecla, leading a chaste life in pursuit of spirituality would be a small sacrifice compared to giving up both their youthful bodies and freedoms in an unwilling exchange for marriage.  In the greater sense, the Christianity may have been particularly appealing to early Christian women because it would have provided them the window of opportunity to leave the private sphere, escape the burdens of managing a family, and contribute to society publicly by spreading God’s message.</p>

<p>Paul’s influence on Thecla is dangerous because his teachings uproot the basic unit that shapes the Greco-Roman world: the family. As Paul spreads his message of how God will reward those who remain chaste, Thecla discovers an escape from her family’s expectations. Yet Paul’s influence on Thecla disrupts the internal stability of her family, as evidenced by the family’s reactions to Thecla’s abnormal behavior: “Thamyris [wept] for the loss of a wife, Theoclia [wept] for that of a child, and the maidservants [wept] for that of a mistress” (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 10). In addition, Paul’s words shatter another definitive characteristic of weak group, strong grid society that characterizes the Greco-Roman world; as “many women and virgins” become drawn to his words, Paul subverts the fixed status quo of men’s dominance over women as he is depicted as “the sorcerer” who has “misled all our wives.” (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 6,15, Kraemer 15). Paul’s influence towards virgin women is so strong that he is even, though inadvertently, destroying the very foundation that sets the base for a family: marriage.  An unmarried woman has far more freedom in her life than her married counterpart because she, the unmarried woman, is not coerced to align her interests with those of her nonexistent husband. And subsequently, with more unmarried women capable of acting in the patriarchal public sphere, the previously distinct gender roles of men and women may gradually begin to blur.</p>

<p>The rise of Christianity in the old Greco-Roman world marks the creation of a weak group, strong grid community within the framework of the strong group, weak grid world. Albeit to some qualifications in the way that Christianity may be reflected in the “Acts of Thecla”, the smaller Christian sphere, as perceived from Thecla’s perspective and in contrast with the predominant Greco-Roman world, is characterized by minimized gender distinctions and sexual asceticism rather than stringent male-female social domains (Kramer 15). In the “Acts of Thecla,” Paul spreads his message by asserting that “blessed are the bodies of the virgins, for they shall be well pleasing to God and shall not lose the reward of their chastity” (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 6). This message appears to be very appealing to virgin women of antiquity, such as Thecla, because of the promise of a better life with greater potentials and possibilities than the only other alternative aforementioned.  Through her conversion to this new faith and her spreading of the Lord’s message, Thecla not only ensures herself God’s protection from the very worst of persecution but is also guaranteed a blissful afterlife, a guaranteed happy ending no matter of what physical death she may encounter. In addition, the chastity that accompanies a life of spirituality may be perceived in a positive light by these women as their bodies would remain pure, free from masculine contamination and subsequent subjugation. The Douglas model, applied in the context to depict Thecla’s old Greco-Roman and new Christian world, is significant in the wider sense as it illuminates the changing roles of virgin women upon their decision to convert to Christianity. The “strong group” nature of the early Christian world may be a result of self-ostracism due to the novel appearance of such a powerful monotheistic religion in a predominantly polytheistic society. Yet, the development of such a strong faith among all believers, no matter of what gender, may have been instrumental in enabling converted women, such as Thecla, to shape Christian society in ways that would not have been possible for women in the public Greco-Roman society.</p>

<p>After her conversion, Thecla’s new role in the Christian society almost immediately begins to take shape. After refusing the sexual advances of a man, Thecla is condemned to a public execution by beasts. In the process, she prays and self-baptizes, and her pleas are heard by God who protect her from death. When the governor calls her out from the midst of the beasts, she proclaims her salvation to the governor, and the governor moved by her devotion to God, declares her clothed and freed (<em>Thecla</em> Chapters 26-38). This event not only exemplifies her devout faith for God, but it is this devoutness that enables her to spread her message and have such a strong influence on others, in this case, the governor, a man of power. Thecla’s example here also marks one vital aspect of Christianity that triumphs standard religious views of Greco-Roman society: Christians, no matter of what gender, are willing to die for their beliefs. This singularity enables the formation of a strong religious group with a unique identity (strong group). In addition, gender distinctions are blurred (weak grid) in the formation of the new Christian community because the impact that a Christian had on the community correlates to the strength of the individual’s faith. This is highly evident in the “Acts” because Thecla is saved by God from her death by fire not because of her gender, but because of her display of earnest affection towards God’s messenger Paul and Paul’s teachings (<em>Thecla</em> Chapter 19-20). The Christian message, as displayed through Paul’s words in the “Acts of Thecla,” paves the way for the creation of an egalitarian society in which status is achieved, not ascribed (Kraemer 16).  An individual’s respect in the early Christian community is dependent upon his or her public display of faith. Thecla’s devoutness to her faith as revealed in the public arena enables her to earn her salvation and marks her as a paradigm for future Christian women to follow.</p>
