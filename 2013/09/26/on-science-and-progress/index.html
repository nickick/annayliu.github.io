            <p>In the tenth stage of his <em>Sketch for an Historical Essay on the Progress of the Human Mind</em>, Condorcet produces a vision of optimism for the future condition of mankind: that through scientific advances, and in turn, moral and social progress, the human mind is capable of pursuing perfection. He concludes that “the perfectibility of man is indefinite,” as nature has endowed man the <em>natural</em> capacity to reason and not placed limits on the growth of that capacity. Thus as man’s capacity to reason naturally expands, it is only fitting that progress will build upon progress, enabling the human mind to continuously redefine the “perfectibility of man.”</p>

<p>Throughout his work, Condorcet has considered the history and future state of man as “possessing the natural faculties and organization that he has at present,”– that is, how Condorcet perceived the physiological state of the human body and mind during his time. In his concluding remarks, he ponders “How much greater would be the certainty, how must vaster the scheme of our hopes if we could believe that these natural faculties themselves and this organization could also be improved? I will seek to provide a modern-day answer to his question: that yes, the “natural faculties and organization” of man can be improved, as evident through the evolution of the human brain and the dynamics of the human nervous system. I will consider Condorcet’s thoughts on medicine and examine recent breakthroughs in the biological sciences in order to provide a scientific perspective on his vision for the progress of the human mind.</p>

<p>Condorcet held a premature notion of natural selection when he regards “organic perfectibility or deterioration” as “one of the general laws of nature” that can be applied to the human race.  Natural selection is a gradual, non-random process by which biological traits that confer an advantage of survival for an organism in a certain environment appear more frequently in the given population, and over time, can result in the emergence of new species. The evolution of the human race is a result of natural selection, a fundamental biological principle which Condorcet would have considered as “one of the general laws of nature” to explain the complexity of diversity in life. The genes passed down from our ancestors encode for favorable characteristics which are necessary to not only fulfill our instinctive needs but also develop the human mind that is capable of conscious experience and intelligent thought.</p>

<p>Recent stem cell research has been applied to the field of evolutionary anthropology to provide an explanation for the evolution of the human brain. Stem cells are characterized by their ability to propagate indefinitely through symmetrical division, resulting in two equivalent daughter cells. Stem cells also have the potential to differentiate into specialized cells, like neurons, through asymmetric division, resulting in a daughter progenitor stem cell and a fated daughter cell. What differentiates a human brain from those of other animals is its size, due to the increase in the size of gyration and the number of neurons and glial cells present.</p>

<p>Again, natural selection is at work through evolutionary time scales. It is possible that the evolution of morphological differences seen in the size of the neocortex among primates is a result of the regulation of neural stem cell divisions. At some point along the evolutionary time scale, changes in the genome of an organism, for example, through mutations of genes or modifications in genetic structure, during early development up-regulated the symmetrical division of neural stem cells into asymmetrical division in order to produce more neurons, a process that can be deemed as an advantageous biological trait. These changes accumulated over time, increasing the brain size of newly emerged species to what is now present in the human race.</p>

<p>From a modern biology perspective, the physiological construct of the human brain is a naturally-occurring phenomena. As the human brain increased in size, new neurons formed new connections to develop information processing networks that support higher level cognitive and executive functions, expanding our mental capacities to feel, think, and do. Therefore from a philosophical standpoint, we are endowed by nature with the ability to reason because the human race is a product of natural selection; we possess the biological traits that have been selected towards  what Condorcet would ascribe as “organic perfection.” And as a result of the human biological development, the human mind also came into being, enabling us to possess such powerful cognitive processes as emotion, imagination, perception, and reason. The human brain is biologically wired for the potential to expand our intellectual and moral faculties, if not our “natural faculties and organization”, through our behaviors and experiences.</p>

<p>Condorcet believed that improvements in the development of preventative medicine and medical practice may enable the perfection of human species capable of indefinite progress. The twentieth century was a time of rapid progress in medicine and healthcare that Condorcet himself may have envisioned for in his future. The successful purification of penicillin in the early 1940′s was an unprecedented step in paving the way for improvements in the treatment of infectious bacterial diseases. Antibiotics are useful in medicine because they bind to and kill the bacteria without harming  the human host; purified penicillin was potent against a wide range of bacterial strains and activity and had low toxicity in humans. The development of such a powerful therapeutic drug  revived an interest in the research and discovery of similar antibiotic compounds for safe and efficient medical treatment.</p>

<p>In addition, the twentieth century was introduced to several successful vaccines that cured what were once commonly known childhood diseases such as mumps, measles and rubella, and subsequently lowered the mortality rate of children; the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950’s and the eradication of smallpox in the 1960’s and 1970’s were also major medical milestones that prolonged the lives of people stricken with once fatal diseases. As Condorcet envisioned, medical progress, in the form of successful use and proliferation of vaccines and antibiotics during the twentieth century, increased “the average length of human life” and provided “a better health and a stronger physical constitution” for people to live out their lives. Medical progress enables us to expand our natural potential because the process of medical discovery requires logic reasoning and deduction, and the discovered medicine in turn can improve our physical health, prolong the average life span, and provide the opportunity for us to continue pursuing our scientific endeavors. Medical progress and the progress of reason synergize in a positive feedback loop: as Condorcet wrote how “the progress of reason and of the social order” ensures the efficacious “improvement of medical practice,” medical progress in turn can influence the progress of reason, and ultimately the social order.</p>

<p>Advances in medicine have the potential to improve our “natural faculties” by increasing our lifespan, providing more time, more opportunities, and more possibilities to learn from experience, and ultimately, to use what we have learned to influence the human condition, scientifically, and in turn politically and morally, towards progress. “The end of infectious and hereditary diseases and illnesses” improves our physical health to further support our mental capacities to think and reason. Condorcet reasoned that progress in medicine would subsequently drive progress in scientific research; as the most immediate causes of a disease are known (“climate, food, or working conditions”), it is only natural for us to investigate the next immediate cause of a disease’s progression in the hopes of eliminating its most distant and fundamental cause. Today, innovations in technology and developments in scientific research methods continue to fuel medical progress in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. In recent years, biology has enabled us to investigate the molecular basis of bacterial diseases and the genetics of hereditary disorders; neuroscience to map the abnormal brain circuitry of patients with psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative illnesses; pharmacology to understand the dynamics of chemical compounds in our bodies; etc., etc. The list of scientific achievements to date is endless, but nevertheless, it is a record of progress, a progress that demonstrates the commitment of the human mind to scientific reasoning in the hopes of improving the condition of mankind through advancements in medicine.</p>

<p>While medicine is a way to improve our physical health to further support our mental capacities, our conscious experiences provide the physiological means to further expand our mental capacities. The human brain is dynamic: it enables us to be adaptive and flexible while we interact with the environment. Changes in our behavior, for example, through learning and memory, can cause physical changes in how neurons are connected through synapses to form the vast neural network of the nervous system. Condorcet considered that “analogy, investigation of the human faculties, and the study of certain facts… would further push back the boundaries of our hopes.” Indeed, the central aim of neuroscience is to learn about the cellular and physiological underpinnings of human behaviors and mental activities, and to understand the neural processes that respond to a diverse array of stimuli and encode unique responses in return. The scientific method provides a means of observation and experimentation to seek evidence and validate hypotheses, enabling us to logically comprehend the biological constructs of the human mind. Through such scientific reasoning, we are able to perceive the “natural faculties and organization” that provides the basis for our mental capacities. In order to further our intellectual and moral potentials, we can in turn shape and expand on our mental capacities through acts of learning and reasoning.</p>

<p>Condorcet inferred how the “physical organization” could be influenced, if not perfected, by first perfecting “the intellect, the power of the brain, the adour of the soul or the moral sensibility” through education. Learning shapes the development of the brain during childhood and adolescence, maintains the plasticity of the brain during adulthood and may even promote the growth of new neurons through neurogenesis. Connections between neurons, called synapses, can be modified on the molecular levels through our experiences and interactions with the environment; this phenomenon, known as synaptic plasticity, is a result of up-regulated genetic expressions that can permanently alter a neuron’s signal transduction mechanism and a neural network’s information processing properties. On a higher anatomical scale, synaptic plasticity can strengthen the communications between brain regions, such as those responsible for encoding higher mental functions, like distinguishing between the good and bad and recognizing future consequences from present actions, and mental faculties, like thought and consciousness, that are attributed to the human mind. The human brain is powerful because it not only provides us with the potential to reason, but can also be physiologically modulated to increase our mental capabilities if we harness that potential to reason. Learning, especially education, can “influence, modify, and perfect the organization itself”; it has the capacity to alter the very structure of neurons, to strengthen neural transmissions, and to enhance the brain processes that enable us to realize and expand our natural potential, and in turn, promote scientific, political, and moral progress.</p>

<p>Man is not immortal, and thus it may appear at first that the growth of his natural potential is limited by old age. It may also seem that the growth of his natural potential is a futile endeavor; after we solve one problem, we pursue another curiosity, on a ceaseless journey that can be halted by death alone. However, the natural potential of man cannot be underestimated because the knowledge we have attained during our ephemeral physical existence can be passed down and built upon from generation to generation. Even from a scientific perspective, we can see how humans are naturally endowed with the capacity to reason and the potential to promote the progress of the human mind through reason. The only limits that prevent the growth of a man’s natural potential are those that he has built up.</p>

<p>Likewise on a societal level, the growth of reason can be hindered through the establishment of authoritative institutions that promote ignorance and superstition to prevent the common man from attaining knowledge and developing his mind through his natural potential.  Condorcet believed that institutions of authority could be destroyed by the impact of a scientific revolution, and that scientific progress in turn would provide the principles for the establishment of an ideal society. That ideal society is a liberal democracy that sets no artificial boundaries for the natural growth of reason and functions to promote the indefinite progress of the human mind.</p>
